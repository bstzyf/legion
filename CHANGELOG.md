Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [7.1.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **`/legion:retro`** — Structured sprint retrospective command. Reviews completed phases/milestones, identifies what worked vs. didn't, surfaces reusable patterns, and writes findings to `.planning/memory/RETRO.md`. Supports `--phase N`, `--milestone M`, cross-project mode, and `--dry-run`.
- **`/legion:ship`** — Ship & deploy pipeline command. Pre-ship quality gate (6 checks), structured PR creation, deployment verification, and optional canary monitoring loop (`--canary`). Extends the plan → build → review lifecycle with a formal shipping stage.
- **`/legion:learn`** — Explicit pattern recording command. Record, recall, and list project-specific patterns, pitfalls, and preferences. Operationalizes the memory-manager's PATTERNS.md, ERRORS.md, and PREFERENCES.md files.
- **Ship pipeline skill** (`skills/ship-pipeline/`) — Pre-ship gates, ship report generation, PR body template, and canary monitoring protocol.
- **Security review skill** (`skills/security-review/`) — OWASP Top 10 structured checklist and STRIDE threat modeling. Plugs into review-evaluators as 5th evaluator type.
- **Security Evaluator** and **Completeness Evaluator** — 5th and 6th review evaluator types in review-evaluators skill.
- **Plan-stage 7-pass design review** (design-workflows Section 7) — Scores design completeness across 7 dimensions (0-10) during `/legion:plan`.
- **Design consultation workflow** (design-workflows Section 8) — Aesthetic direction proposals, safe-vs-risk framing, AI slop blacklist, font guidance, coherence validation.
- **Post-implementation design audit** (design-workflows Section 9) — 74-item audit across 10 categories with dual A-F scoring.
- **Auto-pipeline mode** (`/legion:plan --auto`) — Chains board → decomposition → critique → design review → security scan without user gates.
- **Backend-frontend parallel design waves** — Wave 2A (backend architecture) + Wave 2B (frontend design) + Wave 3 (integration design).

### Changed
- **Agent roster consolidated (53 → 49)** — 4 merges: Evidence Collector + Reality Checker → QA Verification Specialist; Instagram Curator + Twitter Engager → Social Platform Specialist; Content Creator + Social Media Strategist → Content & Social Strategist; Infrastructure Maintainer + DevOps Automator → Infrastructure & DevOps Engineer.
- **9 agents enhanced** with gstack-inspired traits: sprint-prioritizer (10-star thinking, scope modes), senior-developer (architecture lock-in, code review authority), ui-designer (7-pass scoring, AI slop detection, font expertise), ux-architect (performance-as-design), ux-researcher (3-layer competitive analysis), security-engineer (OWASP checklist, STRIDE), technical-writer (post-release doc sync).
- **Completeness checks** added to plan-critique skill.
- **Marketing division** restructured: 8 → 4 agents with clear strategy → execution hierarchy.

### Stats
- 16 commands, 30 skills, 49 agents

## [7.0.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Board of Directors** (`/legion:board`) — governance escalation tier with dynamic agent composition, 5-phase deliberation (assess → discuss → vote → resolve → persist), and audit trail persistence
- **Cross-CLI Dispatch** — infrastructure for routing work to external CLIs (Gemini, Codex, Copilot) via capability-based matching with file-based result handoff
- **Multi-pass review evaluators** — four specialized evaluator types (Code Quality, UI/UX, Integration, Business Logic) with domain-specific pass lists
- **Anti-sycophancy review rules** — injected into all review agent prompts to ensure rigorous, specific, actionable feedback
- **Structured review requests** — auto-populated review context from SUMMARY.md files
- Dispatch configuration sections in Gemini, Codex, and Copilot adapters
- Board and dispatch settings in settings.json with JSON Schema validation

### Changed
- `review` settings extended with `evaluator_depth` and `coverage_thresholds`
- Status dashboard shows recent board decisions and pending conditions
- Workflow-common-core skill mapping includes `/legion:board` command

## [6.0.4] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Codex CLI detection mismatch** — `detection.primary` was checking a nonexistent `CODEX_VERSION` environment variable instead of the actual `.codex/prompts/legion-start.md` file path used by workflow-common and the installer. Detection now matches across all three sources.
- **Codex CLI model names outdated** — Replaced legacy `o3`/`codex`/`o3-mini` model references with current `gpt-5.4`/`gpt-5.3-codex`/`gpt-5.1-codex-mini`. Restored verified `spawn_agents_on_csv` reference and noted `.codex/prompts/` deprecation in favor of skills.
- **Codex CLI quirk accuracy** — `sandbox-execution-only` renamed to `sandbox-by-approval-mode` (sandbox behavior depends on approval mode). `no-interactive-prompts` renamed to `no-structured-question-tool` (CLI is interactive, just lacks structured question tools).
- **Gemini CLI parallel execution outdated** — Updated `parallel_execution` from `false` to `true` (shipped Jan 2026). Rewrote wave execution section for parallel subagent dispatch. Added `experimental-agent-spawning` quirk. Corrected `max_prompt_size` from 1000000 to 1048576.
- **OpenCode capabilities overstated** — `parallel_execution` corrected from `true` to `false` (Task tool blocks synchronously). `native_task_tracking` corrected from `true` to `false` (not a built-in feature). Added `sequential-task-tool` quirk.
- **Copilot CLI context window** — `max_prompt_size` updated from 64000 to 128000. Renamed `short-context-window` quirk to `model-dependent-context-window`.
- **Kiro CLI subagent limitations undocumented** — Added `subagent-tool-restrictions` quirk and new documentation section listing tools unavailable in subagents (no MCP, no web_search, no web_fetch).

### Added
- **Detection cross-reference test** — New conformance test verifying that each adapter's `detection.primary` value is semantically consistent with the corresponding workflow-common Step 1 entry. Prevents detection mismatches like the Codex bug from going undetected.
- **Prompt size enforcement** — Wave executor Step 4.9 estimates token count before spawning and warns at 80% of `adapter.max_prompt_size`, blocks at 95%. Operationalizes the previously declared-but-unenforced `max_prompt_size` field.
- **Agent path resolution for non-Claude runtimes** — Step 1.5 in the Agent Path Resolution Protocol now checks `~/.legion/agents/` before falling through to manifest.json, matching the `storageLayout: 'legion'` used by 8 of 9 runtimes.

## [6.0.3] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Release checksum drift** — `checksums.sha256` generation now derives from the actual npm publish allowlist plus npm's always-included package metadata and `bin` entrypoints, preventing CI from regenerating a different manifest during publish.
- **Runtime metadata conformance** — Synced the Windsurf adapter frontmatter display name with the authoritative runtime metadata contract used by the conformance tests.
- **Package metadata sync** — Updated the lockfile package version to match the published package version so release metadata is internally consistent.

## [6.0.2] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **AskUserQuestion enforcement (strengthened)** — Added MANDATORY rule in CLAUDE.md (top-level project instructions) requiring all `/legion:` commands to use the `AskUserQuestion` tool for user-facing questions. Reinforces the workflow-common-core instruction from 6.0.1 which alone was insufficient.

## [6.0.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **AskUserQuestion enforcement** — Added explicit instruction in workflow-common-core requiring all `adapter.ask_user` calls to use the `AskUserQuestion` tool instead of outputting questions as raw text.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Plan schema hardening** — `files_forbidden`, `expected_artifacts`, mandatory `verification_commands` in all plan frontmatter.
- **Wave safety** — File overlap detection and `sequential_files` convention to prevent parallel write conflicts.
- **Control modes** — `autonomous`/`guarded`/`advisory`/`surgical` presets in settings.json with per-mode authority enforcement.
- **Observability** — Decision logging in SUMMARY.md, cycle-over-cycle diff tracking in REVIEW.md.
- **Agent metadata enrichment** — `languages`, `frameworks`, `artifact_types`, `review_strengths` fields in all 53 agent frontmatter files.
- **Recommendation engine v2** — Metadata-aware scoring, `task_type` tracking in OUTCOMES.md, archetype-weighted boosts.
- **Validation and conformance** — Adapter conformance tests, cross-reference validation, lint-commands, `max_prompt_size`/`known_quirks` in ADAPTER.md.
- **Codebase mapper enrichment** — Dependency risk assessment and test coverage summary in CODEBASE.md output.
- **Polymath advanced modes** — Onboard, compare, and debate modes in `/legion:explore`.
- **Authority and conflict resolution** — Escalation automation protocol, structured agent-to-agent communication conventions.
- **Intent routing v2** — Natural language intent parsing and context-aware command suggestions.

### Changed
- All 53 agent personality files enriched with structured metadata for recommendation engine consumption.
- All 9 adapter files updated with conformance metadata (`max_prompt_size`, `known_quirks`).
- Control mode system integrated across build, review, and plan commands.

### Stats
- 11 phases, 22+ plans executed
- 1056 tests passing

## [5.0.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **`/legion:explore` command** — Polymath-driven codebase exploration with breadth-first discovery, curiosity-driven deep dives, and structured insight reports.
- **Authority boundaries** — YAML domain matrix defining autonomous vs. human-approval-required decisions per agent division, with escalation protocol enforcement.
- **Intent-driven execution** — Flag-based task filtering (`--just-harden`, `--just-document`, `--skip-frontend`, `--just-security`) for scoped phase execution without full rebuild.
- **Two-wave parallelism** — Wave executor enhanced with parallel dispatch within dependency waves, doubling throughput for multi-plan phases.
- **Environment mapping** — Automatic detection of runtime environment with path enforcement, adapter diagnostics, and platform-specific configuration validation.
- **`engineering-security-engineer` agent** — New specialist for security hardening, threat modeling, and vulnerability assessment (Engineering division, 53 agents total).
- **`product-technical-writer` agent** — New specialist for API documentation, user guides, and technical content (Product division).

### Changed
- Agent roster refined: removed 2 niche marketing agents, added 2 critical specialists (security-engineer, technical-writer) — net count 51 → 53.
- All project state files, commands, skills, adapters, and documentation updated from 52 to 53 agent count.
- Polymath agent (`agents/polymath.md`) added as cross-division generalist for exploration workflows.

### Stats
- 5 phases, 22 plans, 32 requirements fulfilled
- 124 commits, 332 files changed, +66,764 / -3,861 lines
- 377+ tests passing

## [3.0.2] - 2026-03-04

- **Critical**: Removed circular self-dependency in `package.json`.
- **Critical**: Removed dead file path references in 3 agent personalities (`design-ux-architect`, `testing-evidence-collector`, `testing-reality-checker`).
- **Critical**: Removed orphan `</output>` XML tags from all 11 command files.
- **Critical**: Fixed `settings.schema.json` to allow `$schema` property.
- Fixed corrupted markdown headings in `engineering-mobile-app-builder`, `engineering-rapid-prototyper`, and `marketing-app-store-optimizer` (4 headings with encoding artifacts).
- Fixed `agent.md` git add target (`SKILL.md` → `CATALOG.md`) and removed dead `workflow-common.md` reference.
- Fixed hard-coded review cycle limit in `review.md` — now reads `{max_cycles}` from settings.
- Fixed hard-coded project name in `review.md` completion message.
- Fixed `portfolio.md` casing inconsistency (`PORTFOLIO.md` → `{adapter.global_config_dir}/portfolio.md`).
- Made `github-sync` conditional in `milestone.md` (only loads when `gh` is authenticated).

- Fixed `review-loop` escalation trigger to include WARNINGs alongside BLOCKERs.
- Fixed `wave-executor` agent extraction to use frontmatter only (removed body-search fallback).
- Removed duplicated command-to-skill mapping table from `workflow-common` shim.
- Fixed Engineering division count (`7` → `8` agents) in `portfolio-manager`.
- Fixed recommendation engine agent eviction to replace lowest-ranked (last) instead of highest-ranked (first).
- Added 10-second timeout to `fetchNpmLatest` in installer to prevent hanging on unresponsive registry.
