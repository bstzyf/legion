## [6.0.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Plan schema hardening** — `files_forbidden`, `expected_artifacts`, mandatory `verification_commands` in all plan frontmatter.
- **Wave safety** — File overlap detection and `sequential_files` convention to prevent parallel write conflicts.
- **Control modes** — `autonomous`/`guarded`/`advisory`/`surgical` presets in settings.json with per-mode authority enforcement.
- **Observability** — Decision logging in SUMMARY.md, cycle-over-cycle diff tracking in REVIEW.md.
- **Agent metadata enrichment** — `languages`, `frameworks`, `artifact_types`, `review_strengths` fields in all 53 agent frontmatter files.
- **Recommendation engine v2** — Metadata-aware scoring, `task_type` tracking in OUTCOMES.md, archetype-weighted boosts.
- **Validation and conformance** — Adapter conformance tests, cross-reference validation, lint-commands, `max_prompt_size`/`known_quirks` in ADAPTER.md.
- **Codebase mapper enrichment** — Dependency risk assessment and test coverage summary in CODEBASE.md output.
- **Polymath advanced modes** — Onboard, compare, and debate modes in `/legion:explore`.
- **Authority and conflict resolution** — Escalation automation protocol, structured agent-to-agent communication conventions.
- **Intent routing v2** — Natural language intent parsing and context-aware command suggestions.

### Changed
- All 53 agent personality files enriched with structured metadata for recommendation engine consumption.
- All 9 adapter files updated with conformance metadata (`max_prompt_size`, `known_quirks`).
- Control mode system integrated across build, review, and plan commands.

### Stats
- 11 phases, 22+ plans executed
- 1056 tests passing

## [5.0.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **`/legion:explore` command** — Polymath-driven codebase exploration with breadth-first discovery, curiosity-driven deep dives, and structured insight reports.
- **Authority boundaries** — YAML domain matrix defining autonomous vs. human-approval-required decisions per agent division, with escalation protocol enforcement.
- **Intent-driven execution** — Flag-based task filtering (`--just-harden`, `--just-document`, `--skip-frontend`, `--just-security`) for scoped phase execution without full rebuild.
- **Two-wave parallelism** — Wave executor enhanced with parallel dispatch within dependency waves, doubling throughput for multi-plan phases.
- **Environment mapping** — Automatic detection of runtime environment with path enforcement, adapter diagnostics, and platform-specific configuration validation.
- **`engineering-security-engineer` agent** — New specialist for security hardening, threat modeling, and vulnerability assessment (Engineering division, 53 agents total).
- **`product-technical-writer` agent** — New specialist for API documentation, user guides, and technical content (Product division).

### Changed
- Agent roster refined: removed 2 niche marketing agents, added 2 critical specialists (security-engineer, technical-writer) — net count 51 → 53.
- All project state files, commands, skills, adapters, and documentation updated from 52 to 53 agent count.
- Polymath agent (`agents/polymath.md`) added as cross-division generalist for exploration workflows.

### Stats
- 5 phases, 22 plans, 32 requirements fulfilled
- 124 commits, 332 files changed, +66,764 / -3,861 lines
- 377+ tests passing

## [3.0.2] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed `plugin_discovery_glob` in all 9 adapters — agent auto-discovery was broken on every runtime.
- **Critical**: Removed circular self-dependency in `package.json`.
- **Critical**: Removed dead file path references in 3 agent personalities (`design-ux-architect`, `testing-evidence-collector`, `testing-reality-checker`).
- **Critical**: Removed orphan `</output>` XML tags from all 11 command files.
- **Critical**: Fixed `settings.schema.json` to allow `$schema` property.
- Fixed corrupted markdown headings in `engineering-mobile-app-builder`, `engineering-rapid-prototyper`, and `marketing-app-store-optimizer` (4 headings with encoding artifacts).
- Fixed `agent.md` git add target (`SKILL.md` → `CATALOG.md`) and removed dead `workflow-common.md` reference.
- Fixed hard-coded review cycle limit in `review.md` — now reads `{max_cycles}` from settings.
- Fixed hard-coded project name in `review.md` completion message.
- Fixed `portfolio.md` casing inconsistency (`PORTFOLIO.md` → `{adapter.global_config_dir}/portfolio.md`).
- Made `github-sync` conditional in `milestone.md` (only loads when `gh` is authenticated).
- Added `design-workflows` conditional load to `plan.md` for DSN-* requirements.
- Fixed `Step 4.5` → `Step 6` references in `phase-decomposer` and `review-panel` skills.
- Fixed `agent-creator` validation threshold (50 → 80 lines) and Section 4 heading format.
- Fixed `workflow-common-core` skill mapping for `/legion:start` (added `portfolio-manager`, moved `codebase-mapper` to always-loads).
- Fixed `review-loop` escalation trigger to include WARNINGs alongside BLOCKERs.
- Fixed `wave-executor` agent extraction to use frontmatter only (removed body-search fallback).
- Removed duplicated command-to-skill mapping table from `workflow-common` shim.
- Fixed Engineering division count (`7` → `8` agents) in `portfolio-manager`.
- Fixed recommendation engine agent eviction to replace lowest-ranked (last) instead of highest-ranked (first).
- Added 10-second timeout to `fetchNpmLatest` in installer to prevent hanging on unresponsive registry.
- Updated agent count from 51 to 52 across project state files.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- Synced package versioning with CHANGELOG and added release consistency checks.
- Added runtime support tiers and clearer installer/runtime diagnostics.
- Updated README metrics and support disclosures to match the repository state.
- Promoted minimum agent size enforcement to a hard validation failure (80-line floor).

### Added
- Installer integrity verification with `--verify` using `checksums.sha256`.
- New release guardrails (`scripts/release-check.js`) for docs/version/skill-map consistency.
- Default `settings.json` configuration and JSON schema.
- Baseline CI and smoke tests for installer workflows.
