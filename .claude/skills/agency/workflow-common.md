# Agency Workflow Common

Shared constants, paths, and patterns used across all /agency: commands.

## State File Locations

| File | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| PROJECT.md | `.planning/PROJECT.md` | Project vision, requirements, constraints, decisions |
| ROADMAP.md | `.planning/ROADMAP.md` | Phase breakdown with agent assignments and progress |
| STATE.md | `.planning/STATE.md` | Current position, recent activity, next action |
| Templates | `.planning/templates/` | Schema files for generating PROJECT/ROADMAP/STATE |
| Phase Plans | `.planning/phases/{NN-name}/` | Plan and summary files per phase |
| PORTFOLIO.md | `~/.claude/agency/portfolio.md` | Global portfolio registry — all Agency projects |
| Milestone Summaries | `.planning/milestones/MILESTONE-{N}.md` | Completion summaries with metrics per milestone |
| Milestone Archive | `.planning/archive/milestone-{N}/` | Archived phase directories from completed milestones |
| Memory Outcomes | `.planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md` | Agent performance and task outcome records for cross-session learning |
| Custom Agents | `agency-agents/{division}/{agent-id}.md` | User-created agent personality files (via `/agency:agent`) |

## Agent Personality Paths

All 51 agent personalities live under `agency-agents/` organized by division:

```
agency-agents/{division}/{agent-id}.md
```

**Divisions**: engineering, design, marketing, product, project-management, testing, support, spatial-computing, specialized, custom

Custom agents created via `/agency:agent` follow the same personality path pattern. The `custom` division is created on first use if it doesn't exist.

To load an agent personality: `Read agency-agents/{division}/{agent-id}.md`

## Personality Injection Pattern

To spawn an agent with its full personality inside a Claude Code Team:

1. Read the agent's .md file to get the full personality content
2. Construct a prompt that includes the personality as system instructions, plus a **Reporting Results** block instructing the agent to send its structured summary via SendMessage:
   ```
   Agent tool call:
     subagent_type: "general-purpose"
     prompt: "{personality_content}\n\n---\n\nTask: {task_description}\n\n## Reporting Results\n..."
     model: "{cost_profile_model}"
     team_name: "{phase_team_name}"
   ```
3. The agent operates in full character with access to its specialist knowledge
4. When finished, the agent sends its structured summary to the coordinator via SendMessage (not via Agent return value). This keeps the coordinator's context window small.

## Plan File Convention

```
.planning/phases/{NN-name}/{NN}-{PP}-PLAN.md    — Executable plan
.planning/phases/{NN-name}/{NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md  — Completion summary
.planning/phases/{NN-name}/{NN}-CONTEXT.md        — Phase research/context
```

Naming: `{NN}` = zero-padded phase number, `{PP}` = zero-padded plan number.
Example: `.planning/phases/01-plugin-foundation/01-02-PLAN.md`

## Wave Execution Pattern

Plans declare a `wave` number in frontmatter. Execution uses a Claude Code Team per phase:

1. **TeamCreate** — create one Team for the entire phase (e.g., `"phase-{NN}-execution"`)
2. **TaskCreate** — create one Task per plan, setting `addBlockedBy` for cross-wave dependencies
3. Group plans by wave number
4. For each wave, **spawn agents** via Agent tool with `team_name` set to the phase Team
5. Agents execute their plans and **report results via SendMessage** to the coordinator
6. Coordinator collects SendMessage summaries — wait for all agents in the wave before advancing
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for subsequent waves
8. **Shutdown + TeamDelete** — send `shutdown_request` to all agents, then TeamDelete to clean up

Within a wave, plans have no dependencies on each other. Between waves, later waves may depend on earlier wave outputs. Agents send lightweight structured summaries (~200 tokens) via SendMessage instead of returning full execution traces, preserving the coordinator's context window.

## State Update Pattern

After any significant operation:

1. Read current `.planning/STATE.md`
2. Update relevant fields:
   - `Phase`: current phase number and status
   - `Status`: what just happened
   - `Last Activity`: timestamp and description
   - `Progress`: recalculate completion percentage
   - `Next Action`: what the user should do next
3. Write updated STATE.md

## Cost Profile Convention

| Role | Model | When |
|------|-------|------|
| Planning/Decisions | Opus | /agency:start, /agency:plan, architecture choices |
| Execution/Implementation | Sonnet | /agency:build, agent task execution |
| Lightweight Checks | Haiku | /agency:status, quick validations, simple queries |

Set via `model` parameter on Agent tool calls.

## Error Handling Pattern

When an agent fails during execution:

1. Capture the error output
2. Update STATE.md: mark the failed plan/task with error details
3. Do NOT retry automatically — present the error to the user
4. Suggest: re-run the specific plan, or run /agency:review for diagnosis
5. If multiple agents fail in a wave, stop the wave and report all failures

## Division Constants

```
DIVISIONS = [
  "engineering",        # 7 agents — code, architecture, DevOps
  "design",             # 6 agents — UI/UX, branding, visual
  "marketing",          # 8 agents — content, social, growth
  "product",            # 3 agents — sprints, feedback, trends
  "project-management", # 5 agents — coordination, portfolio
  "testing",            # 7 agents — QA, evidence, performance
  "support",            # 6 agents — analytics, finance, legal
  "spatial-computing",  # 6 agents — XR, VisionOS, Metal
  "specialized"         # 3 agents — orchestration, data, LSP
]

TOTAL_AGENTS = 51
```

## Portfolio Conventions

### Global Portfolio Path
The portfolio registry lives at `~/.claude/agency/portfolio.md` — outside any project directory. This file is shared across all Agency projects on the machine.

### Portfolio Registration
Projects are auto-registered in the portfolio when `/agency:start` completes. Registration stores the project name, absolute path, registration date, and one-line description.

### Cross-Project State Reading
Portfolio commands read each registered project's `.planning/STATE.md` and `.planning/ROADMAP.md` at request time. There is no background sync. If a project directory is missing, it's marked Stale.

### Portfolio Command Convention
| Command | Purpose | Cost Tier |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `/agency:portfolio` | Multi-project dashboard and dependency management | Haiku (dashboard), Opus (Studio Producer insights) |

## Milestone Conventions

### Milestone Definition
Milestones group consecutive phases in ROADMAP.md under a `## Milestones` section. Each milestone has a name, phase range, goal, and status. Milestones are defined interactively via `/agency:milestone` or during `/agency:start` for new projects.

### Milestone Lifecycle
```
Pending → In Progress → Complete → Archived
```
- **Pending**: No phases started
- **In Progress**: At least one phase started
- **Complete**: All phases in range are Complete in the Progress table
- **Archived**: Phase directories moved to `.planning/archive/milestone-{N}/`

### Milestone Paths
| Artifact | Path | When Created |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Milestone section | `.planning/ROADMAP.md ## Milestones` | During milestone definition |
| Milestone summary | `.planning/milestones/MILESTONE-{N}.md` | On milestone completion |
| Archive directory | `.planning/archive/milestone-{N}/{NN-name}/` | On milestone archiving |

### Milestone Command Convention
| Command | Purpose | Cost Tier |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `/agency:milestone` | Milestone status, completion, archiving, and definition | Haiku (status), Sonnet (summary generation) |

## Memory Conventions

### Memory Purpose
Cross-session learning layer that tracks agent performance and task outcomes. All memory operations are explicit calls from workflows — no hooks, no background processes, no automatic triggers.

### Memory Lifecycle
```
Absent → Created (first store) → Growing (appending records) → Mature (200+ records, pruning suggested)
```
- **Absent**: No `.planning/memory/` directory. All workflows function identically.
- **Created**: First build or review outcome triggers `.planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md` creation.
- **Growing**: Records accumulate as phases execute and review.
- **Mature**: When record count exceeds 200, recall suggests pruning. Never auto-prunes.

### Memory Paths
| Artifact | Path | When Created |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Memory directory | `.planning/memory/` | On first store operation |
| Outcome log | `.planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md` | On first store operation |

### Memory Integration Points
| Workflow | Operation | When |
|----------|-----------|------|
| `/agency:build` | Store outcome | After each plan completes (success, partial, or failed) |
| `/agency:review` | Store outcome | After review passes or escalates |
| `/agency:plan` | Recall agent scores | During agent recommendation (phase-decomposer Section 4) |
| `/agency:status` | Recall session briefing | During dashboard display |

### Graceful Degradation Rule
All memory integration follows this pattern:
1. Check if `.planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md` exists
2. If yes: use memory data to enhance the operation
3. If no: skip silently, proceed with default behavior
4. Never error, never block, never require memory for workflow completion

## GitHub Conventions

### GitHub Purpose
Optional integration that connects Agency Workflows to GitHub — phases link to issues, completed work produces PRs, and milestones sync. All operations use the `gh` CLI and are entirely opt-in.

### GitHub Prerequisites
```
1. gh CLI installed (checked via `which gh`)
2. gh authenticated (checked via `gh auth status`)
3. Git remote pointing to GitHub (checked via `git remote get-url origin`)
All three must pass for GitHub operations to be available.
```

### GitHub Lifecycle
```
Unavailable → Available (prerequisites pass) → Active (first issue created) → Synced (milestones linked)
```
- **Unavailable**: No gh CLI, no auth, or no remote. All GitHub operations skip silently.
- **Available**: Prerequisites pass. Operations can be performed.
- **Active**: At least one GitHub issue has been created. STATE.md has a ## GitHub section.
- **Synced**: ROADMAP milestones have corresponding GitHub milestones.

### GitHub Paths
| Artifact | Location | When Created |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| GitHub metadata | `.planning/STATE.md ## GitHub` section | On first issue or PR creation |
| Agency label | GitHub repo labels | On first issue creation |
| Phase issues | GitHub issues with "agency" label | During `/agency:plan` |
| Phase PRs | GitHub pull requests | During `/agency:build` |
| GitHub milestones | GitHub API milestones | During `/agency:plan` (if ROADMAP milestones defined) |

### GitHub Integration Points
| Workflow | Operation | When |
|----------|-----------|------|
| `/agency:plan` | Create phase issue, sync milestone | After plan files generated |
| `/agency:build` | Update issue checklist, create PR | After plans execute and after phase completes |
| `/agency:status` | Read-back live GitHub status | During dashboard display |
| `/agency:review` | Close phase issue | After review passes |
| `/agency:milestone` | Close GitHub milestone | After milestone completion |

### Graceful Degradation Rule
All GitHub integration follows this pattern:
1. Run github-sync Section 1 prerequisites check
2. If github_available is true: perform the operation
3. If github_available is false: skip silently, proceed with default behavior
4. Never error, never block, never require GitHub for workflow completion
