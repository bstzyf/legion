# Agent Catalog

Complete catalog of all 48 built-in agents across 9 divisions, plus any custom agents created via `/legion:agent`. Also contains the Task Type Index (reverse mapping from project need to recommended agents).

The recommendation algorithm and team assembly patterns are in `SKILL.md` in this directory.

> **Path Note:** The `agents/` paths in the File column below are relative to the plugin root directory.
> Consumers must NOT use bare `agents/{agent-id}.md` paths directly. Instead, resolve
> `AGENTS_DIR` using the **Agent Path Resolution Protocol** from `workflow-common` and read
> personality files as `{AGENTS_DIR}/{agent-id}.md`. This ensures correct resolution in both
> local development (CWD = plugin root) and global plugin installations.

---

> **Metadata Enrichment (Phase 5):** All 48 agents now include `languages`, `frameworks`, `artifact_types`, and `review_strengths` fields in their YAML frontmatter. These fields enable structured filtering and scoring for agent recommendation. Phase 6 (Recommendation Engine v2) will score against these fields.

## Section 2: Intent Routing

Intent flags (`--just-*`, `--skip-*`) dynamically compose agent teams for specific execution modes. These are not fixed assignments — intents are resolved at runtime from `.planning/config/intent-teams.yaml`.

### Intent-to-Agent Mappings

| Intent | Mode | Primary Agents | Secondary Agents | Description |
|--------|------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| harden | ad_hoc | testing-qa-verification-specialist, engineering-security-engineer | testing-api-tester | Security audit with Testing + Security divisions |
| document | filter_plans | product-technical-writer | engineering-frontend-developer | Generate documentation without implementation |
| skip-frontend | filter_plans | — | — | Exclude frontend/UI tasks and agents |
| skip-backend | filter_plans | — | — | Exclude backend/API tasks and agents |
| security-only | filter_review | engineering-security-engineer | testing-api-tester | Security-only review audit |

### Cross-Reference with Divisions

- **harden**: Combines Testing (qa-verification-specialist, api-tester) + Engineering (security-engineer)
- **document**: Uses Product (technical-writer) + Engineering (frontend-developer for component docs)
- **security-only**: Security-focused subset of harden team for review filtering

### Notes

- Intent teams are **dynamic compositions**, not fixed agent assignments
- Agents may appear in multiple intent mappings
- Primary agents are always spawned; secondary agents are spawned based on workload
- Filter intents (`skip-*`, `document`) don't spawn agents directly — they filter existing plans
