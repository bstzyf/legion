## Conflict Resolution Quick Reference

| Scenario | Rule |
|----------|------|
| Same domain, multiple agents | Higher specificity wins (see hierarchy below) |
| Overlapping domains | Both active, findings merged |
| Out-of-domain critique | Filtered when domain owner present |
| Severity disagreement | BLOCKER from any agent overrides WARNING |
| Implementation vs Operations | DevOps owns impl, Infrastructure Maintainer owns ops |

### Specificity Hierarchy

1. **Level 1** (Highest): Specific tool/framework (e.g., "laravel", "visionos")
2. **Level 2**: Domain subcategory (e.g., "api-design", "accessibility")
3. **Level 3**: Broad domain (e.g., "security", "performance")
4. **Level 4** (Lowest): General concerns (e.g., "full-stack", "code-quality")

---

## Team Assembly Guidelines

### When Multiple Agents Claim a Domain

1. Check specificity hierarchy — more specific beats general
2. Check task context — implementation vs review vs operations
3. When in doubt, include both and let authority-enforcer handle conflicts

### Example Conflict Resolutions

| Situation | Resolution |
|-----------|------------|
| Both security-engineer and backend-architect on panel | security-engineer owns security findings; backend-architect defers on security domain |
| Both testing-performance-benchmarker and testing-api-tester on panel | API performance → API tester defers to performance benchmarker; General performance → performance benchmarker leads |
| Both devops-automator and infrastructure-maintainer on panel | DevOps owns CI/CD pipeline design; Infrastructure Maintainer owns production operations |
| Both polymath and trend-researcher on panel | Polymath leads exploration phase; Trend Researcher provides market context |

## Usage in Plans

When assigning agents in a plan, reference this registry:

```markdown
<task type="auto">
  <name>Security Audit</name>
  <assigned_agent>engineering-security-engineer</assigned_agent>
  <rationale>Security domain authority per DOMAINS.md</rationale>
</task>
```

When reviewing findings, check against this registry to ensure domain owners weren't overridden:

```markdown
<review>
  <finding>
    <reviewer>testing-reality-checker</reviewer>
    <criterion>Security vulnerability in auth flow</criterion>
    <action>DEFERRED — routed to security-engineer per domain ownership</action>
  </finding>
</review>
```
