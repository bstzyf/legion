# Legion Agent Registry

Complete catalog of all agent personalities. Includes 52 built-in agents across 9 divisions plus any custom agents created via `/legion:agent`. Use this registry to assemble the right team for any project task.

> Agent catalog and task-type index are in `CATALOG.md` in this directory.

## Section 3: Recommendation Algorithm

When assembling a team for a task, follow this semantic-first process:

### Step 1: Parse Intent and Constraints
Extract:
- Primary objective (build, review, optimize, diagnose, launch)
- Domain signals (engineering, design, marketing, testing, product, support, spatial)
- Hard constraints (platform, runtime, deadline, no-new-dependencies, etc.)

**Custom agents:** Custom agents added via `/legion:agent` are first-class candidates in every step below.

### Step 2: Build a Semantic Shortlist (Primary Ranking)
Map natural-language intent to normalized concepts before any point scoring.

Baseline concept normalization:
- `scalability`, `latency`, `throughput` -> `performance`
- `harden`, `exploit`, `vulnerability` -> `security`
- `a11y`, `wcag`, `screen reader` -> `accessibility`
- `funnel`, `conversion`, `growth loop` -> `growth`
- `refactor`, `cleanup`, `maintainability` -> `code-quality`
- `onboarding`, `activation`, `retention` -> `product`

Shortlist rules:
1. Prefer agents with direct semantic overlap between normalized concepts and `task_types`.
2. Include cross-division specialists when their specialty text clearly matches intent.
3. Keep shortlist to top 6-8 agents before tie-breaking.

### Step 3: Apply Heuristic Tiebreak (Secondary)
Use points only to break ties inside the semantic shortlist:
- **Exact task-type match**: +3
- **Partial specialty match**: +1
- **Division alignment**: +2

Notes:
- Heuristics refine ranking; they do not replace semantic intent matching.
- If no semantic shortlist forms, fall back to heuristic scoring across all agents and label low confidence.

### Step 4: Confidence Classification
Classify confidence from top-candidate quality:
- **High confidence**: strong semantic alignment + top score >= 8
- **Medium confidence**: partial semantic alignment or top score 5-7
- **Low confidence**: weak semantic evidence or top score <= 4

If confidence is low:
1. Label recommendation explicitly as low confidence.
2. Offer 2-3 alternatives from different divisions.
3. Ask for user guidance before locking assignment.

### Score Export

After scoring, produce a structured score breakdown for each recommended agent:

```
score_export:
  task_type_detected: "{extracted task type from intent parsing}"
  candidates:
    - agent_id: "{agent-id}"
      semantic_score: "{quality of semantic overlap: strong|moderate|weak}"
      heuristic_score: {numeric total from tiebreak rules}
      memory_boost: {numeric boost from OUTCOMES.md or 0}
      total_score: {heuristic_score + memory_boost}
      confidence: "{HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW}"
    - agent_id: "{agent-id-2}"
      ...
  adapter: "{adapter name from current CLI}"
  model_tier: "{planning|execution|check}"
  recommendation_source: "{semantic|heuristic|memory|override}"
```

This score breakdown is:
- **Produced** by agent-registry during recommendation
- **Consumed** by wave-executor when writing SUMMARY.md (see OBS-01)
- **Optional** — if recommendation was skipped (autonomous task), no export is generated

### Step 5: Team Size and Composition Guardrails
- **2 agents** for single-domain tasks.
- **3 agents** for standard feature work.
- **4 agents** for cross-domain work.
- Never exceed 4 agents for one discrete task; split larger efforts.

### Step 6: Apply Memory Boost (Optional, Additive Only)
If `.planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md` exists:
1. Recall agent scores via memory-manager.
2. Add memory score to shortlisted agents only.
3. Re-rank candidates.
4. Show memory influence in output (for transparency).

Constraints:
- Memory boost is additive and cannot override mandatory-role constraints.
- Memory boost cannot promote unrelated agents with zero semantic/heuristic relevance.
- Agents with fewer than 2 recorded outcomes are excluded from memory boosting.
- If memory is unavailable, skip silently.

### Step 7: Enforce Mandatory Roles
- **Execution teams** (code-writing/deployment) MUST include at least one Testing-division agent.
- **Cross-division teams** MUST include a coordinator: `project-manager-senior`, `project-management-project-shepherd`, or `agents-orchestrator`.
- **User-facing change teams** SHOULD include a Design-division reviewer.

Mandatory role additions should be reflected in the score_export with `recommendation_source: "mandatory"`.

### Step 8: Conflict Resolution
- If two agents remain tied in one division, prefer broader production reliability for delivery tasks.
- For exploratory work, prefer rapid-learning profiles (`engineering-rapid-prototyper`, `project-management-experiment-tracker`).
