# Gap Analysis Engine

A comprehensive skill for analyzing agent roster coverage gaps against production-grade role requirements.

---

## Section 1: Overview

### Purpose
The Gap Analysis Engine identifies coverage gaps between the current agent roster and production-grade role requirements. It analyzes agent capabilities, validates intent team references, scores production role coverage, and generates actionable gap reports.

### When to Use
- **Quarterly roster reviews**: Run gap analysis every 3 months to track coverage evolution
- **Before adding new agents**: Validate that new agents fill actual gaps, not create redundancy
- **Production readiness assessments**: Identify blocking gaps before production deployment
- **Intent team changes**: Re-analyze when intent-teams.yaml is modified
- **Post-roster changes**: After adding, removing, or consolidating agents

### Input Sources
1. **roster-gap-config.yaml**: Configuration with role definitions, scoring weights, and severity thresholds
2. **CATALOG.md**: Agent registry with divisions and task types
3. **intent-teams.yaml**: Intent-to-agent mappings for validation
4. **agents/*.md**: Individual agent personality files for capability extraction

### Output
- **Gap report**: Markdown document with severity-classified gaps and recommendations
- **Coverage matrix**: Mapping of agents to production roles with scores
- **Limit compliance status**: 52-agent limit analysis
- **Actionable recommendations**: Prioritized agent creation/removal suggestions

---

## Section 2: Gap Analysis Algorithm

The gap analysis follows a 7-step algorithm:

### Step 1: Load Configuration
```
parseRosterGapConfig() → Config
```

1. Read `.planning/config/roster-gap-config.yaml`
2. Extract configuration sections:
   - `agent_limit`: Maximum allowed agents (52)
   - `role_categories`: Production role definitions by category
   - `scoring`: Coverage strength weights
   - `severity`: Gap severity thresholds
   - `intent_teams_to_check`: Intents requiring validation
   - `replacement_candidates`: Agents for potential removal
3. Validate configuration schema
4. Return structured config object

**Validation Rules:**
- `agent_limit` must be positive integer
- Each role must have required_capabilities list
- Severity thresholds must be ordered (critical > high > medium > low)

### Step 2: Parse Agent Registry
```
parseAgentCatalog(catalogPath) → Agent[]
```

1. Read `skills/agent-registry/CATALOG.md`
2. Extract agent entries from division tables
3. For each agent, extract:
   - `agent_id`: kebab-case identifier
   - `division`: Primary division assignment
   - `specialty`: Brief capability description
   - `task_types`: Array of task type strings
4. Count total agents
5. Build agent capability index (task_type → agents[])

**Agent Count Verification:**
```
if current_count > agent_limit:
  flag limit_exceeded violation
  suggest replacement candidates
```

### Step 3: Validate Intent Teams
```
validateIntentTeams(agents, intentTeams) → ValidationResult
```

1. Read `.planning/config/intent-teams.yaml`
2. For each intent in `intent_teams_to_check`:
   - Extract all referenced agent IDs
   - Check each against parsed agent list
   - Record orphaned references (agents not in roster)
3. Build validation report:
   - Valid intents: All agents exist
   - Invalid intents: Missing agents listed
   - Impact assessment for each missing agent

**Orphaned Reference Detection:**
```javascript
const orphaned = intentAgents.filter(
  agentId => !rosterAgents.includes(agentId)
);
```

### Step 4: Map Agents to Production Roles
```
calculateCoverage(agents, productionRoles) → CoverageMatrix
```

For each production role in config:
1. Identify potential covering agents:
   - Match agent task_types to role coverage_indicators
   - Check agent specialty descriptions for keywords
   - Cross-reference with division alignment
   
2. Score coverage strength:
   - **FULL (1.0)**: Agent directly implements role capabilities
   - **PARTIAL (0.5)**: Agent covers subset of role capabilities
   - **MINIMAL (0.2)**: Agent tangentially related to role
   - **NONE (0.0)**: No relevant coverage

3. Calculate composite coverage:
   ```
   coverage_score = sum(covering_agents.strength * weight)
   coverage_percentage = min(coverage_score * 100, 100)
   ```

4. Record gaps:
   - List uncovered capabilities
   - Note coverage strength for each covering agent

### Step 5: Identify Gaps
```
identifyGaps(coverageMatrix, config) → Gap[]
```

For each under-covered role:
1. Calculate gap_score:
   ```
   gap_score = 1.0 - coverage_percentage
   ```

2. Determine severity:
   - Match gap_score to severity thresholds
   - Adjust based on role priority:
     - Critical priority roles: Severity +1 level
     - Nice-to-have roles: Severity -1 level (min: low)

3. Build gap record:
   ```yaml
   gap:
     role: role_id
     role_priority: critical|important|nice_to_have
     current_coverage: coverage_percentage
     gap_score: float
     severity: critical|high|medium|low
     covering_agents: [agent_ids]
     missing_capabilities: [capability_strings]
     recommendation: create_agent|enhance_existing|accept_gap
   ```

### Step 6: Check 52-Agent Limit
```
checkAgentLimit(currentCount, limit, candidates) → LimitStatus
```

1. Compare current_count vs agent_limit
2. Calculate overage: `overage = max(0, current_count - limit)`
3. Determine status:
   - **COMPLIANT**: current_count ≤ limit
   - **EXCEEDED**: current_count > limit

4. If exceeded:
   - Sort replacement_candidates by removal_difficulty
   - Suggest candidates for consolidation/removal
   - Calculate agents to remove: `remove_count = overage`

5. Build limit status report:
   ```yaml
   limit_status:
     current: 49
     limit: 52
     status: EXCEEDED
     overage: 1
     suggestions:
       - consolidate: [support-analytics-reporter, data-analytics-reporter]
       - remove: [marketing-tiktok-strategist]
   ```

### Step 7: Generate Report
```
generateGapReport(gaps, limitStatus, config) → Report
```

1. Group gaps by severity
2. Sort within severity by gap_score (descending)
3. Generate executive summary:
   - Total gaps by severity
   - Critical issues count
   - Limit compliance status
   
4. Build detailed findings:
   - Missing referenced agents
   - Coverage gaps by requirement
   - Recommendations with priority

5. Output formatted report to `.planning/phases/40-roster-gap-analysis/`

## Section 3: Production Role Coverage Mapping

This section documents the specific coverage analysis for ROSTER requirements.

### ROSTER-01: Gap Identification ✓

**Status**: Engine operational

The gap analysis engine successfully identifies coverage gaps through:
- Agent catalog parsing
- Intent team validation
- Production role coverage scoring
- Severity classification

### ROSTER-02: SRE-Equivalent Coverage ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Current Coverage Analysis:**

| Role | Covering Agents | Coverage Strength | Gaps |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|------|
| sre_reliability_engineer | engineering-infrastructure-devops | PARTIAL (0.5) | Formal SLOs, error budgets, incident response playbooks |
| sre_reliability_engineer | engineering-infrastructure-devops | PARTIAL (0.5) | Reliability focus, SRE practices |
| chaos_engineer | testing-performance-benchmarker | MINIMAL (0.2) | Failure injection, game days |
| platform_engineer | engineering-infrastructure-devops | PARTIAL (0.5) | Developer platforms, self-service |
| observability_engineer | engineering-infrastructure-devops | PARTIAL (0.5) | Distributed tracing, advanced metrics |
| observability_engineer | data-analytics-reporter | MINIMAL (0.2) | Data-focused, not observability-focused |

**Composite Coverage:**
- sre_reliability_engineer: **50%** (PARTIAL)
- chaos_engineer: **20%** (MINIMAL)
- platform_engineer: **50%** (PARTIAL)
- observability_engineer: **35%** (PARTIAL)

**Category Score**: 38.75% coverage

**Gap Assessment:**
```yaml
severity: MEDIUM
impact: "Infrastructure covered, formal SRE practices incomplete"
missing_capabilities:
  - SLO definition and management
  - Error budget tracking
  - Chaos engineering capabilities
  - Runbook automation
  - Formal incident response playbooks
  - Distributed tracing expertise
```

**Recommendation:**
- Short-term: Enhance engineering-infrastructure-devops with SRE capabilities
- Long-term: Consider dedicated SRE agent or rename/expand existing agent

### ROSTER-03: Security-Auditor Coverage ⚠️ HIGH GAP

**Current Coverage Analysis:**

| Role | Covering Agents | Coverage Strength | Gaps |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|------|
| security_engineer | *NONE* | NONE (0.0) | **AGENT MISSING** |
| security_engineer | testing-api-tester | MINIMAL (0.2) | Only API security testing |
| compliance_auditor | support-legal-compliance-checker | PARTIAL (0.5) | Legal focus, not security |
| penetration_tester | testing-api-tester | MINIMAL (0.2) | Limited to API pen testing |
| pii_specialist | support-legal-compliance-checker | PARTIAL (0.5) | GDPR/privacy covered |

**Composite Coverage:**
- security_engineer: **20%** (MINIMAL - CRITICAL GAP)
- compliance_auditor: **50%** (PARTIAL)
- penetration_tester: **20%** (MINIMAL)
- pii_specialist: **50%** (PARTIAL)

**Category Score**: 35% coverage

**Gap Assessment:**
```yaml
severity: HIGH
impact: "No dedicated security engineer - referenced agent missing"
missing_capabilities:
  - OWASP Top 10 comprehensive audit
  - STRIDE threat modeling
  - Secure code review
  - Vulnerability assessment
  - Security architecture review
  - Security testing beyond APIs
```

**Critical Finding:**
The `engineering-security-engineer` is referenced in:
- `harden` intent (primary agent)
- `security-only` intent (primary agent)
- CATALOG.md Section 2 (Intent Routing)

But this agent **does not exist** in the agents/ directory.

**Recommendation:**
- **CRITICAL**: Create engineering-security-engineer immediately
- Blocks `harden` intent functionality
- Required for production security audits

### ROSTER-04: Data-Scientist Coverage ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Current Coverage Analysis:**

| Role | Covering Agents | Coverage Strength | Gaps |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|------|
| data_scientist | data-analytics-reporter | PARTIAL (0.5) | Pipelines/ETL covered, not modeling |
| data_scientist | engineering-ai-engineer | MINIMAL (0.2) | ML focus, not data science |
| ml_engineer | engineering-ai-engineer | FULL (1.0) | ML model development covered |
| data_engineer | data-analytics-reporter | FULL (1.0) | Data pipelines covered |

**Composite Coverage:**
- data_scientist: **35%** (PARTIAL)
- ml_engineer: **100%** (FULL ✓)
- data_engineer: **100%** (FULL ✓)

**Category Score**: 78.33% coverage

**Gap Assessment:**
```yaml
severity: MEDIUM
impact: "Analytics and ML covered, formal data science missing"
missing_capabilities:
  - Statistical modeling
  - Hypothesis testing
  - Experimental design
  - Data visualization storytelling
  - A/B test analysis
  - Predictive analytics
```

**Recommendation:**
- Medium-term: Consider splitting data-analytics-reporter into:
  - data-engineer (pipelines, ETL) - already covered
  - data-scientist (modeling, statistics) - needs creation
- Or: Enhance data-analytics-reporter with data science capabilities

### ROSTER-05: Agent Creation Workflow

**Status**: ✓ READY

The `/legion:agent` workflow is functional and documented in:
- `commands/agent.md`: Command entry point
- `skills/agent-creator/SKILL.md`: Creation skill

**Constraint:** Cannot create new agents while over 52-agent limit.

### ROSTER-06: 52-Agent Limit

**Current Status:** ❌ EXCEEDED

```yaml
limit_analysis:
  current_count: 49
  agent_limit: 52
  status: EXCEEDED
  overage: 1
  
  root_cause: |
    Polymath agent (agents/polymath.md) was added in Phase 36
    without removing another agent to maintain limit.
    
  compliance_options:
    - option: accept_49
      description: "Update roadmap to accept 49-agent roster"
      effort: low
      impact: "Violates original constraint, requires documentation update"
      
    - option: consolidate_analytics
      description: "Merge support-analytics-reporter + data-analytics-reporter"
      effort: medium
      impact: "Maintains analytics coverage, reduces count by 1"
      recommendation: preferred
      
    - option: remove_niche
      description: "Remove 1 niche agent (marketing-tiktok-strategist)"
      effort: low
      impact: "Loses niche capability, maintains core coverage"
      
    - option: increase_limit
      description: "Increase limit to 54 (requires roadmap change)"
      effort: medium
      impact: "Permanent increase, sets precedent"
```

**Recommended Action:**
Consolidate support-analytics-reporter and data-analytics-reporter into a single data-analytics-specialist agent.

## Section 4: Intent Teams Gap Analysis

This section documents specific findings from intent team validation.

### harden Intent

**Purpose:** Security audit with Testing + Security divisions

**Referenced Agents:**
| Agent | Exists | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| testing-qa-verification-specialist | ✓ YES | Available |
| **engineering-security-engineer** | ✗ **NO** | **CRITICAL GAP** |
| testing-api-tester | ✓ YES | Available |
| testing-qa-verification-specialist | ✓ YES | Available |

**Impact Analysis:**
The `harden` intent references `engineering-security-engineer` as a **primary agent**. Without this agent:
- Intent cannot function as designed
- Falls back to partial team (testing agents only)
- Security expertise missing from security audit
- Violates intent's core purpose

**Gap Classification:** CRITICAL

### document Intent

**Purpose:** Generate documentation without implementation

**Referenced Agents:**
| Agent | Exists | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **product-technical-writer** | ✗ **NO** | **HIGH GAP** |
| engineering-frontend-developer | ✓ YES | Available (fallback) |

**Impact Analysis:**
The `document` intent references `product-technical-writer` as the **primary agent**. Without this agent:
- Intent falls back to frontend-developer
- Suboptimal documentation quality
- Developer-focused docs, not user-focused
- Violates intent separation of concerns

**Gap Classification:** HIGH

### security-only Intent

**Purpose:** Security-only review audit

**Referenced Agents:**
| Agent | Exists | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **engineering-security-engineer** | ✗ **NO** | **CRITICAL GAP** |
| testing-api-tester | ✓ YES | Available |

**Impact Analysis:**
The `security-only` intent is designed for security-focused reviews. Without the security engineer:
- Cannot perform comprehensive security audits
- Limited to API security testing only
- Missing threat modeling capabilities

**Gap Classification:** CRITICAL

```

### Compliance Options Analysis

**Option 1: Accept 49-Agent Roster**
- **Effort**: Low
- **Pros**: Simplest solution, no agent changes
- **Cons**: Violates original constraint, sets precedent for future increases
- **Recommendation**: Not preferred

**Option 2: Consolidate Overlapping Agents** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- **Action**: Merge support-analytics-reporter + data-analytics-reporter
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Pros**: 
  - Maintains full analytics capability
  - Eliminates redundancy
  - Single agent owns full analytics lifecycle
- **Cons**: 
  - Requires agent personality merge
  - May lose some specialization
- **New Agent**: data-analytics-specialist

**Option 3: Remove Niche Agent**
- **Candidate**: marketing-tiktok-strategist
- **Effort**: Low
- **Pros**: Quick fix, minimal impact on core functionality
- **Cons**: Loses TikTok-specific marketing capability
- **Recommendation**: Acceptable short-term fix

**Option 4: Increase Limit**
- **New Limit**: 54
- **Effort**: Medium (requires roadmap update)
- **Pros**: Accommodates current roster
- **Cons**: Permanent increase, harder to justify later
- **Recommendation**: Not preferred

### Recommended Path Forward

1. **Immediate**: Consolidate analytics agents (support-analytics-reporter + data-analytics-reporter → data-analytics-specialist)
2. **Phase 40-02**: Create missing agents (engineering-security-engineer, product-technical-writer)
3. **v5.1**: Re-analyze roster and consider removing niche agents if count approaches limit again
