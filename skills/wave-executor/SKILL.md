description: Executes wave-structured plans with personality-injected agents — parallel or sequential per CLI adapter
triggers: [build, execute, parallel, wave, dispatch, spawn]
token_cost: high
summary: "Executes wave-structured plans via the active CLI adapter. Parallel within waves (if adapter supports it), sequential between. Full personality injection, adapter-based result collection. Core engine for /legion:build."
---

# Wave Executor

Engine for `/legion:build`. Takes the plan files in a phase directory and executes them in wave order — spawning personality-injected agents in parallel within each wave, waiting for completion before advancing to the next wave. The full flow: discover plans, validate structure, inject personalities, spawn parallel agents, collect results, write summaries, report.

---

## Section 1: Execution Principles

These rules govern all execution decisions. Do not deviate from them.

> **MANDATORY: Follow the active CLI adapter's Execution Protocol.**
>
> Before executing any plans, load the active adapter (see workflow-common CLI Detection Protocol).
> The adapter defines how agents are spawned, coordinated, and cleaned up.
>
> **If adapter.parallel_execution is true AND adapter.structured_messaging is true** (e.g., Claude Code):
> Use the adapter's full coordination lifecycle (e.g., TeamCreate → TaskCreate → Agent with team_name → SendMessage → TeamDelete on Claude Code).
> On Claude Code specifically: `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` must be enabled.
> If Teams are unavailable, stop and tell the user to enable the flag.
>
> **If adapter.parallel_execution is true but adapter.structured_messaging is false** (e.g., Cursor):
> Spawn agents in parallel. Collect results via file system per adapter.collect_results.
>
> **If adapter.parallel_execution is false** (e.g., Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Aider):
> Execute plans sequentially within each wave. No agent spawning may be needed —
> use adapter.spawn_agent_personality or execute inline per adapter protocol.
>
> This is not optional. Always consult the adapter before spawning agents.

1. **Wave-sequential, parallel-within** — all Wave 1 plans must complete before any Wave 2 plan begins. Within a wave, plans run simultaneously if `adapter.parallel_execution` is true, or sequentially if false.
2. **Full personality injection** — each agent receives the ENTIRE contents of its assigned personality `.md` file. No summaries, no excerpts, no paraphrasing. On CLIs without agent spawning, personality is a prompt prefix in the current session.
3. **Adapter model for execution** — all spawned agents use `adapter.model_execution`. This matches the Cost Profile Convention from `workflow-common.md`.
4. **No automatic retries** — if an agent fails, capture the error output and stop the wave. Report to the user. Do not re-spawn the failed agent. See Error Handling Pattern in `workflow-common.md`.
5. **Each plan produces a summary** — after an agent completes, write a `{NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md` file to the phase directory, whether the result is success or failure.
6. **Orchestrator stays in main context** — the `/legion:build` command itself does not execute plan work. It reads, validates, dispatches, and collects. On CLIs without spawning, personality injection is temporary and dropped after each plan.
7. **Failed wave blocks subsequent waves** — if any plan in a wave fails, do not proceed to the next wave. Report wave status and pause for user decision.
8. **Files isolation per wave** — plans within the same wave must not share files_modified entries. This is guaranteed by plan authoring (see phase-decomposer.md), but flag a warning if a conflict is detected.
9. **Sequential file ordering** — when plans in the same wave declare `sequential_files`, the wave-executor must serialize dispatch for plans that share a sequential file. Plans with no sequential file overlap still execute in parallel. This constraint applies even when `adapter.parallel_execution` is true.
10. **One coordination context per phase** — per adapter protocol: one Team on Claude Code, one checklist file on other CLIs. Not per wave.
11. **Agents report via adapter.collect_results** — spawned agents send their structured completion summary per the adapter's result collection method. This keeps the coordinator's context window small.
12. **Verification-gated completion** — after each task, the agent MUST run all `> verification:` commands from the task's action block. If any verification command returns a non-zero exit code, the task is marked as failed and the agent must report the failure. Do not proceed to the next task until all verifications pass.

---

## Section 2: Plan Discovery

How to find, read, and organize plan files for a phase before any execution begins.

```
Step 1: Determine the phase directory path
  - Read .planning/STATE.md to find the current phase number and slug
  - Or accept a --phase argument from the build command
  - Construct the directory: .planning/phases/{NN}-{phase-slug}/
  - Example: .planning/phases/04-parallel-execution/

Step 2: List all files in the phase directory
  - Read directory contents
  - Filter for files matching: {NN}-{PP}-PLAN.md
  - Exclude: {NN}-CONTEXT.md, {NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md, and any other files
  - Sort plans by plan number (PP) ascending

Step 3: Read each plan file's YAML frontmatter
  For each plan file, parse the frontmatter block (between --- delimiters):
  - wave: integer (required — which execution wave this plan belongs to)
  - depends_on: list of "NN-PP" strings (plans that must complete before this one)
  - autonomous: boolean (true = no agent needed, false = agent-delegated)
  - files_modified: list of file paths this plan creates or modifies
  - sequential_files: list of file paths requiring single-agent sequential access (optional)
  - requirements: list of requirement IDs covered by this plan

Step 4: Build the wave map
  Construct a data structure grouping plans by wave number:
  {
    1: [plan-04-01, plan-04-02],   -- runs first, in parallel
    2: [plan-04-03],               -- runs after wave 1 completes
    3: [plan-04-04, plan-04-05],   -- runs after wave 2 completes
  }

Step 5: Validate the plan structure
  Check all of the following before proceeding:
  a) At least one plan file exists. If not: error "No plans found for Phase {N}.
     Run /legion:plan {N} first."
  b) All depends_on references point to plans in earlier (lower) waves. If a plan
     in wave 2 depends on another wave 2 plan: error "Circular wave dependency
     detected in plan {NN}-{PP}. Plans within the same wave cannot depend on
     each other. Re-run /legion:plan {N} to fix the plan structure."
  c) Each wave number is a positive integer with no gaps above wave 1 (wave 1
     always present; wave 3 allowed only if wave 2 exists).
  d) All files_modified lists are disjoint within each wave (no two plans in the
     same wave modify the same file). If a conflict is found: warn the user —
     do not abort, but flag for review.
  e) If directory mappings exist, verify files_modified paths are valid or have overrides.
     If invalid and strictness=strict: error before execution begins.
  If validation fails on (a), (b), (c), or (e): stop and report the error. Do not execute.

Step 6: Report discovery results
  Before executing, show a discovery summary:
  "Found {total} plans across {wave_count} waves:
   Wave 1: {plan names} ({count} plans)
   Wave 2: {plan names} ({count} plans)
   ..."
```

---

## Section 3: Personality Injection

How to load a full agent personality and construct the execution prompt for each plan.

```
For each plan where autonomous: false:

Step 1: Identify the assigned agent
  - Read the agent-id from the plan's frontmatter `agents:` field
  - Path format: {AGENTS_DIR}/{agent-id}.md  (AGENTS_DIR resolved via workflow-common Agent Path Resolution Protocol)
  - Example: {AGENTS_DIR}/engineering-senior-developer.md

Step 1.5: Validate the agent-id against actual files
  - Attempt to Read {AGENTS_DIR}/{agent-id}.md
  - If the file EXISTS: proceed to Step 2 with this agent-id
  - If the file does NOT exist: the plan may have a hallucinated or abbreviated agent-id.
    Run a fuzzy match:
    a) Extract the suffix after the last hyphen-delimited division prefix
       (e.g., "dev-senior-developer" → "senior-developer",
              "backend-architect" → "backend-architect")
    b) Run: Glob {AGENTS_DIR}/*-{suffix}.md
    c) If exactly ONE match is returned: use that file's agent-id instead
       Log: "Agent ID corrected: {original-id} → {matched-id}"
    d) If MULTIPLE matches: pick the first and log a warning:
       "Multiple agent matches for {original-id}: {matches}. Using {selected}."
    e) If ZERO matches: try a broader search:
       Run: Glob {AGENTS_DIR}/*{last-word-of-id}*.md
       (e.g., "dev-senior-developer" → *developer*.md)
       If exactly one match: use it and log correction
       If multiple matches: use the first and log warning
       If ZERO matches: fall back to autonomous mode and log:
       "No agent file found for {original-id}. Executing plan autonomously."

Step 2: Read the complete personality file
  - Use the Read tool to load the ENTIRE agent .md file
  - Do not truncate, summarize, or excerpt any portion
  - The personality content includes: the agent's identity, specialization, behavioral
    traits, communication style, technical focus areas, and working principles
  - Capture this as: PERSONALITY_CONTENT

Step 3: Read the complete plan file
  - Use the Read tool to load the full plan .md file
  - Capture the section starting from <objective> through end of file as: PLAN_CONTENT

Step 3.5: Load brownfield context (optional)
  - Check if .planning/CODEBASE.md exists
  - If yes:
    a. Read .planning/CODEBASE.md
    b. Extract these sections:
       - "## Agent Guidance" → Preferred and Avoid directives
       - "## Conventions Detected" → all convention bullet points
       - "## Risk Areas" → filter to rows where the Area or file paths overlap
         with the current plan's files_modified list
    c. Compose a CODEBASE_CONTEXT block:

       ## Codebase Context

       ### Conventions
       {bullet list from Conventions Detected}

       ### Agent Guidance
       - **Preferred**: {from Agent Guidance}
       - **Avoid**: {from Agent Guidance}

       ### Risk Areas
       {filtered Risk Areas table rows, or "No risk areas overlap with this plan's files."}

  - If CODEBASE.md does not exist: set CODEBASE_CONTEXT = "" (empty string, no block injected)

Step 3.5b: Receive control mode profile

  The control mode profile is pre-resolved by workflow-common-core's Settings Resolution
  Protocol at invocation start. The wave-executor receives the resolved profile — it does
  NOT read `.planning/config/control-modes.yaml` directly.

  The profile contains 5 boolean flags:
  - authority_enforcement, domain_filtering, human_approval_required, file_scope_restriction, read_only

  If no profile was resolved (legacy invocation): default to guarded profile
  (authority_enforcement=true, domain_filtering=true, human_approval_required=true,
   file_scope_restriction=false, read_only=false)

Step 3.6: Load authority constraints
  - If mode_profile.authority_enforcement is false:
    Set AUTHORITY_CONTEXT = "" (skip all authority boundary injection)
    Skip to Step 3.7
  - Load active agents for this wave from wave map
  - For current agent, identify its exclusive_domains from authority matrix
  - Build AUTHORITY_CONTEXT block:

    ## Authority Boundaries

    You have exclusive authority over these domains:
    {list of exclusive_domains for this agent}

    When you are active, other agents defer to you on these topics.

    Other agents active in this wave with their exclusive domains:
    {for each other agent in wave:
      - {agent-id}: {exclusive_domains}}

    You must NOT critique or override findings from other agents in their exclusive domains.
    You may critique general code quality, but defer to domain owners for specialist topics.

  - If authority matrix does not exist: AUTHORITY_CONTEXT = "" (no constraints)

Step 3.7: Enforce authority during agent spawn

  - If mode_profile.authority_enforcement is false:
    Skip authority enforcement during agent spawn (no domain conflict warnings)

  Before spawning each agent:
  1. Load authority matrix: `.planning/config/authority-matrix.yaml`
  2. Get list of all agents in current wave
  3. For target agent, identify other agents with overlapping domains
  4. If conflicts detected, add warning to wave report:
     "Warning: Agents {agent1} and {agent2} both claim domain {domain}. 
      Both will be active — findings will be merged with severity escalation."

Step 3.8: Validate file placement against directory mappings (ENV-04)

  Before constructing the agent prompt, validate that the plan's files_modified
  are consistent with the project's directory structure. This prevents files
  from being created in incorrect locations during execution.

  3.8.1: Load directory mappings

  Check if `.planning/config/directory-mappings.yaml` exists:
  - If yes: Load mappings and enforcement configuration
  - If no: Skip placement validation (no mappings available)

  3.8.2: Validate each file in files_modified

  For each file path in the plan's `files_modified` frontmatter:

  a. Skip validation for exempt patterns:
     - Files in `.planning/` (planning state has flexible structure)
     - Root-level config files (README.md, .gitignore, etc.)
     - Files matching enforcement.exceptions patterns

  b. Infer the expected category for the file:
     - Use same inference logic as spec-pipeline Section 8.1
     - Check file extension, name patterns, and content type
     - Examples:
       - `**/*.test.js` → tests
       - `**/routes/**` → routes
       - `**/components/**` → components
       - `**/SKILL.md` → skills (Legion-specific)
       - `commands/*.md` → commands (Legion-specific)

  c. Look up allowed directories for the category:
     - Find category in mappings.mappings
     - Get the list of allowed paths
     - Note the enforcement strictness (strict/warn/off)

  d. Validate the file path:
     - Extract directory portion of file path
     - Check if directory matches any allowed path for category
     - Handle nested directories (child of allowed path is valid)

  3.8.3: Handle validation results

  Collect validation results:

  | File | Category | Directory | Valid | Action |
  |------|----------|-----------|-------|--------|
  | {file} | {category} | {dir} | {yes/no} | {allow/warn/block} |

  Action based on strictness and violations:

  - strict + violations: Block wave execution
    ```
    ERROR: File placement violations detected in plan {NN}-{PP}:
      - {file}: Expected in {allowed_dirs} for {category}, got {actual_dir}
    
    Fix: Move files to correct directories or update directory mappings.
    Execution blocked until resolved.
    ```
    Halt wave execution and report to user.

  - warn + violations: Add warning to wave report, allow execution
    ```
    WARNING: File placement issues in plan {NN}-{PP}:
      - {file}: Should be in {suggested_path} for {category}
    
    Files will be created as specified, but this may deviate from project conventions.
    ```
    Continue execution but flag in wave summary.

  - no violations: Continue normally
    Log: "All {N} files validated against directory mappings ✓"

  3.8.4: Allow plan-level overrides

  Plans can override placement validation via frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  phase: XX-name
  plan: NN
  path_override: true
  path_override_reason: "Creating new category not yet in mappings"
  ---
  ```

  When override is present:
  - Skip validation for this plan
  - Log: "Path validation overridden: {reason}"
  - Note in wave summary

### Control Mode Prompt Constraints

After constructing the base agent prompt (personality + task + authority), apply mode-specific constraints from the resolved profile:

When `mode_profile.read_only` is true:
- Append advisory mode constraint to agent prompt:
  "You are in ADVISORY mode. Analyze and suggest improvements but DO NOT modify any files.
   Present your suggestions as a structured list of proposed changes with rationale."
- Suppress `auto_commit` regardless of settings.json value — no commits in advisory mode
- After agent execution, present suggested changes to user without applying them
- Skip the commit step in the execution results

When `mode_profile.file_scope_restriction` is true:
- Append file-scope constraint to agent prompt:
  "You may ONLY modify files explicitly listed in this plan's files_modified field.
   Do not create, edit, or delete any other files. If a task requires touching unlisted
   files, stop and escalate."
- After agent execution, verify that only files listed in plan `files_modified` were touched
- If agent modified unlisted files: flag as a BLOCKER in execution results and present
  to user for decision (revert or accept)
- Note: prompt injection is preventive; post-execution check is detective. Both are needed.

When `mode_profile.human_approval_required` is false:
- Omit escalation protocol reminders from agent prompts

Step 4: Construct the agent execution prompt
  Combine personality and plan using this exact format:

  Step 4.1: Add file placement guidance (conditional)

  If placement validation found warnings or suggestions:
  - Add a FILE_PLACEMENT_CONTEXT block to the prompt

  FILE_PLACEMENT_CONTEXT = """
  ## File Placement Guidance

  This plan includes files that should be placed in specific directories:

  | File | Target Directory | Category |
  |------|-----------------|----------|
  | {file} | {directory} | {category} |

  **Important**: Create files in the specified directories to maintain project structure.
  If a directory doesn't exist, create it first before writing the file.
  """

  If no warnings: FILE_PLACEMENT_CONTEXT = "" (empty)

  Step 4.2: Assemble the full prompt

  """
  {PERSONALITY_CONTENT}

  # Execution Task

  You are executing a plan as part of Legion. Follow the tasks below precisely.

  {AUTHORITY_CONTEXT}

  {CODEBASE_CONTEXT}

  {FILE_PLACEMENT_CONTEXT}

  {PLAN_CONTENT}

  ## Important
  - Execute each task in the order listed
  - Run the <verify> commands after each task to confirm completion before moving on
  - CRITICAL: Extract all `> verification:` lines from each task's <action> block and run them as bash commands
  - Each `> verification:` line is a bash command that must return exit code 0
  - If ANY verification command fails (non-zero exit code):
    a. Record the failed command and its output
    b. Attempt to fix the issue (re-read the task, check your work)
    c. Re-run the failed verification
    d. If it still fails after one fix attempt: mark the task as FAILED in your summary
    e. Do NOT skip failed verifications or proceed to the next task
  - Run verifications in order — they may have implicit dependencies
  - After all tasks complete, run the full <verification> checklist
  - Do NOT modify files outside of the plan's files_modified list unless the task
    explicitly requires it (e.g., updating an import in a file that uses the new file)
  - If a task is ambiguous, apply your specialist expertise to resolve the ambiguity
    and document the decision in your summary

  ## Reporting Results (adapter-conditional)
  When all tasks and verification are complete, report your results:

  **If adapter.structured_messaging is true** (e.g., Claude Code):
  1. Use the adapter's messaging tool to send your structured summary to the coordinator
     (e.g., SendMessage on Claude Code)
  2. Use the adapter's task tracking to mark your task as completed
     (e.g., TaskUpdate on Claude Code)

  **If adapter.structured_messaging is false** (e.g., Codex CLI, Cursor, Aider):
  1. Write your structured summary to: `.planning/phases/{NN}/{NN}-{PP}-RESULT.md`
  2. The coordinator will read this file after your execution completes

  Your summary MUST include these fields:
  - **Status**: Complete | Complete with Warnings | Failed
  - **Files**: list of files created/modified with brief descriptions
  - **Verification**: outputs from <verify> commands
  - **Verification Commands Run**: count of `> verification:` commands executed
  - **Verification Passed**: count that returned exit code 0
  - **Verification Failed**: count that returned non-zero, with command + output for each
  - **Decisions**: key implementation decisions made
  - **Issues**: any problems or warnings encountered (or "None")
  - **Errors**: error details if failed (or "None")
  """

Step 5: Spawn the agent per adapter protocol
  Use adapter.spawn_agent_personality with:
  - prompt: {constructed prompt from Step 4}
  - model: adapter.model_execution
  - name: "{agent-id}-{NN}-{PP}" -- e.g., "engineering-senior-developer-04-01"
  - Additional parameters per adapter (e.g., team_name on Claude Code)

  On CLIs without agent spawning (adapter.agent_spawning = false):
  - Prepend the personality content to the current session context
  - Execute the plan tasks inline within the current session
  - Write the result per adapter.collect_results when complete

For autonomous plans (autonomous: true):

  Step 1: Skip personality loading entirely

  Step 2: Read the complete plan file

  Step 3: Construct the autonomous execution prompt:
  """
  # Execution Task

  - **Decisions**: key implementation decisions made
  - **Issues**: any problems or warnings encountered (or "None")
  - **Errors**: error details if failed (or "None")

  Step 4: Spawn the agent per adapter protocol
  Use adapter.spawn_agent_autonomous with:

  - model: adapter.model_execution
  - name: "executor-{NN}-{PP}" -- e.g., "executor-04-01"
  - Additional parameters per adapter (e.g., team_name on Claude Code)
```

### Personality Loading Notes

- If the personality file does not exist at the expected path, fall back to autonomous execution (no personality). Log: "Warning: personality file not found for {agent-id} at {path}. Executing plan {NN}-{PP} without personality injection."
- The personality content may be 200-500 lines. This is expected and intentional — full injection is the core mechanism that gives agents their specialist behavior.
- Cross-reference agent-registry.md (Section 1: Agent Catalog) for the canonical file path when in doubt.

### Future Optimization: Selective Personality Loading

> **Note**: This documents a future optimization path. No behavioral change is implemented — full injection remains the current approach.

For agents over 300 lines, a future version could split personality into two tiers:

- **Core personality** (~100 lines, always injected): Identity & Memory, Core Mission, Critical Rules, Communication Style — the sections that shape the agent's voice, decision-making, and behavioral boundaries.
- **Extended sections** (loaded conditionally): Technical Deliverables (code templates, report templates, framework configs) — loaded only when the task type matches the template domain.

This would reduce context consumption for large agents (currently 600+ lines) during parallel wave execution, where multiple agents each receive full personality injection. The Wave 3 standardization effort (target: 100-350 lines per agent) is the immediate mitigation — trimming verbose code examples in the largest agents while expanding thin stubs.

## Section 4: Wave Execution

How to execute each wave in order, dispatching plans in parallel within each wave.

```
Step 0: Initialize phase coordination (once, before the wave loop)
  Follow the active adapter's Execution Protocol for initialization:

  **If adapter.parallel_execution is true AND adapter.structured_messaging is true** (e.g., Claude Code):
  - Use adapter.coordinate_parallel to set up coordination infrastructure
    (e.g., TeamCreate, TaskCreate, TaskUpdate on Claude Code — see adapter for exact calls)

  **If adapter.parallel_execution is true but no structured messaging** (e.g., Cursor):
  - Write a WAVE-CHECKLIST.md tracking file to .planning/phases/{NN}/
  - No coordination infrastructure needed — agents work independently

  **If adapter.parallel_execution is false** (e.g., Codex CLI, Aider):
  - Write a WAVE-CHECKLIST.md tracking file to .planning/phases/{NN}/
  - No agent coordination — plans execute sequentially

For each wave number in ascending order (1, 2, 3, ...):

Step 1: Identify plans in the current wave
  - Filter the wave map for the current wave number
  - Collect: plan file paths, agent IDs, autonomous flags

Step 2: Pre-execution dependency check
  - For each plan in this wave, inspect depends_on list
  - Verify each referenced plan (e.g., "04-01") has a corresponding SUMMARY.md file
    in the phase directory (indicating completion)
  - If any dependency SUMMARY.md is missing or contains Status: Failed:
    - Skip the current wave entirely
    - Report: "Wave {N} skipped: dependency plan {NN}-{PP} did not complete
      successfully. Resolve the failure before retrying."
    - Stop execution

Step 3: Construct agent prompts for all plans in the wave
  - For each plan, run the Personality Injection flow from Section 3
  - Prepare all prompts before spawning any agents

Sequential Files Pre-Dispatch Check (before Step 4 agent spawning):
  - Collect sequential_files from all plans in the current wave
  - Build a conflict map: file -> [plan IDs that declare this file]
  - If any file has 2+ plans declaring it:
    The ENTIRE wave falls back to fully sequential dispatch (plan-number order),
    even when adapter.parallel_execution is true.
    This is the simple, safe model -- no mixed parallel+sequential complexity.
  - If no sequential_files overlap exists: dispatch all plans in parallel as before
  - If no sequential_files declared in any plan: skip this check entirely
  - Log: "Sequential file constraint detected: {files}. Wave {N} executing fully sequentially."

Step 4: Execute plans for this wave (adapter-conditional)

  **If adapter.parallel_execution is true** (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor):
  - For a SINGLE plan in the wave:
    - Spawn one agent per adapter.spawn_agent_personality
  - For MULTIPLE plans in the wave:
    - Issue ALL agent spawn calls simultaneously per adapter.coordinate_parallel
    - This maximizes parallelism — agents run concurrently
    - Do NOT spawn agents one at a time for multi-plan waves
    - Each agent gets its own fully-constructed prompt (personality + plan)
    - Agents in the same wave are fully independent — they share no state

  **If adapter.parallel_execution is false** (e.g., Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Aider):
  - Execute plans SEQUENTIALLY within the wave:
    For each plan in ascending order:
    1. Load personality and construct prompt (Section 3)
    2. Execute per adapter.spawn_agent_personality (may be inline on non-spawning CLIs)
    3. Collect result per adapter.collect_results
    4. Write SUMMARY.md before moving to the next plan

Step 5: Collect results (adapter-conditional)

  **If adapter.structured_messaging is true** (e.g., Claude Code):
  - Wait for every agent to send its completion message per adapter.collect_results
  - Each message contains a structured summary (Status, Files, Verification, etc.)
  - If an agent goes idle without sending: follow up per adapter protocol

  **If adapter.structured_messaging is false** (e.g., Cursor, Codex CLI):
  - Read result files written by each agent: .planning/phases/{NN}/{NN}-{PP}-RESULT.md
  - Or read the SUMMARY.md files if already written during Step 4 (sequential execution)

  In all cases, track: which plans succeeded, which failed, what files were modified.

Step 6: Process wave results
  - For each completed agent, run the Agent Result Processing flow (Section 5)
    to generate the SUMMARY.md file
  - Compile the wave completion report:
    Completed: [list of plan names that succeeded]
    Failed: [list of plan names that failed, with error summaries]
    Files modified: [aggregate list across all plans in the wave]
    If sequential ordering was applied:
      "Sequential file ordering applied: plans {list} executed in order due to shared access to {files}"

Step 7: Post-wave decision
  - If ALL plans in the wave completed successfully:
    - Report wave success
    - Proceed to the next wave
  - If ANY plan in the wave failed:
    - Report wave failure with the full list of failed plans and errors
    - STOP — do not proceed to subsequent waves
    - Instruct the user: "Wave {N} had {count} failure(s). Fix the issue and
      re-run /legion:build, or run /legion:review for diagnosis."

Step 8: After all waves complete
  - Report full execution summary: total plans, total waves, files modified
  - Update .planning/STATE.md: mark phase as complete, record completion timestamp
  - Suggest next action: "/legion:review to validate the phase output"

Step 9: Cleanup coordination (adapter-conditional)
  - Use adapter.shutdown_agents to gracefully terminate any spawned agents
  - Use adapter.cleanup_coordination to clean up coordination infrastructure
  - On CLIs without agent spawning: no cleanup needed (no-op per adapter)
  - This step runs on BOTH success and failure paths — never leave orphaned agents
    or stale coordination state behind
```

### CLI-Specific Execution Details

The exact tools and lifecycle depend on the active adapter. See the adapter's Execution Protocol section for the complete implementation.

**Claude Code example** (parallel execution with Teams):
- TeamCreate → TaskCreate → parallel Agent calls → SendMessage collection → TeamDelete
- See `adapters/claude-code.md` for the full lifecycle

**Codex CLI / Gemini CLI example** (sequential execution):
- WAVE-CHECKLIST.md → sequential plan execution → RESULT.md files
- See `adapters/codex-cli.md` or `adapters/gemini-cli.md`

**Cursor example** (parallel execution via async subagents):
- Spawn subagents asynchronously → poll for RESULT.md files
- See `adapters/cursor.md`

All execution models share these invariants:
- The orchestrator waits until all plans in a wave complete before advancing
- Within a wave, agents share no state — each operates on its own plan
- Results are written to SUMMARY.md files regardless of the collection mechanism

---

## Section 5: Agent Result Processing

How to interpret what each agent returns and write the plan summary file.

```
For each completed agent (success or failure):

Step 1: Parse the agent's completion report
  The agent's report (received per adapter.collect_results) contains a structured summary with these fields:
  - **Status**: Complete | Complete with Warnings | Failed
  - **Files**: list of files created/modified with brief descriptions
  - **Verification**: outputs from <verify> commands
  - **Verification Commands Run**: count of `> verification:` commands executed
  - **Verification Passed**: count that returned exit code 0
  - **Verification Failed**: count that returned non-zero, with command + output for each
  - **Decisions**: key implementation decisions made
  - **Issues**: any problems or warnings encountered
  - **Errors**: error details if failed

  Use the Status field directly to determine the result:
  - "Complete" → SUCCESS
  - "Complete with Warnings" → COMPLETE WITH WARNINGS
  - "Failed" → FAILED
  If the Status field is missing or ambiguous, fall back to parsing for signals:
  - SUCCESS indicators: "verification passed", "complete", all verify commands ran
  - FAILURE indicators: "error:", "failed:", "could not", "exception"

Step 2: Determine result status
  - SUCCESS: agent completed all tasks, ALL verification commands passed (exit code 0)
  - COMPLETE WITH WARNINGS: agent completed tasks but some non-critical verify steps had issues
    (e.g., line count slightly below expected but content is correct)
  - FAILED: agent could not complete one or more tasks, OR any `> verification:` command
    returned non-zero exit code and the agent could not fix it after one attempt

  IMPORTANT: Verification failure is a hard gate. Unlike `<verify>` block outputs which
  are advisory, `> verification:` command failures block plan completion. A plan with
  any failed verification command MUST have Status: Failed or Status: Complete with Warnings
  (never Status: Complete).

Step 3: Generate the plan summary file
  Path: .planning/phases/{NN}-{phase-slug}/{NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md

  Write the file using this format:

  ---

  # Plan {NN}-{PP} Summary: {plan_name}

  ## Result
  **Status**: Complete | Complete with Warnings | Failed
  **Wave**: {wave_number}
  **Agent**: {agent-id} | Autonomous
  **Completed**: {timestamp}

  ## Agent Selection Rationale

  > This section is auto-generated from agent-registry score_export data.
  > Omitted for autonomous tasks where no recommendation was run.

  | Candidate | Semantic | Heuristic | Memory | Total | Source |
  |-----------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
  | {selected agent} | {strong/moderate/weak} | {score} | {boost} | {total} | {semantic/heuristic/memory/mandatory} |
  | {runner-up 1} | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
  | {runner-up 2} | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

  - **Task type detected**: {task_type_detected from score_export}
  - **Confidence**: {HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW}
  - **Adapter**: {adapter name}
  - **Model tier**: {planning/execution/check}

  If the plan's `autonomous: true` or no score_export data is available, omit the
  "Agent Selection Rationale" section entirely. Do not output an empty section.

  **Data source**: The executing agent reconstructs the rationale from the plan's context
  (plan frontmatter `agents` field, task descriptions, and agent-registry scoring criteria).
  This is an LLM-native approach — the agent re-derives WHY this agent was selected based on
  the task requirements and agent-registry's scoring rules, rather than consuming a serialized
  data payload. The score_export structure in agent-registry Section 3 defines what fields
  to populate, but the executing agent computes these at SUMMARY.md generation time.

  ## Completed Tasks
  {Summary of actions taken, derived from the agent's return message.
   Should be specific: "Created skills/wave-executor/SKILL.md (312 lines)
   with 6 sections covering plan discovery, personality injection, wave execution,
   result processing, and error handling."}

  ## Files Modified
  - {file path 1} — {brief description of what changed}
  - {file path 2} — {brief description of what changed}

  ## Verification Results
  {Output from the plan's verification steps, as reported by the agent.
   Include actual command outputs where available.}

  ## Verification Commands
  | Command | Exit Code | Result |
  |---------|-----------|--------|
  | `test -f path/to/file.md` | 0 | PASS |
  | `grep -q "Section 1:" path/to/file.md` | 0 | PASS |
  | `wc -l < path/to/file.md \| xargs test 50 -le` | 1 | FAIL — file has 42 lines |

  ## Key Decisions
  {Notable implementation decisions, ambiguities resolved, approaches chosen.
   If none: "No significant decisions — followed plan as written."}

  ## Issues Encountered
  {Any problems, deviations, or warnings. If none: "None."}

  ## Escalations
  {If the agent raised any <escalation> blocks during execution, list them here.
   If none: "None."}

  | # | Severity | Type | Decision | Status | Resolution |
  |---|----------|------|----------|--------|------------|
  | 1 | {severity} | {type} | {decision text} | {pending/approved/rejected/deferred} | {resolution details or "Awaiting decision"} |

  ## Handoff Context
  - **key_outputs**: {list of files created/modified with purpose}
  - **decisions_made**: {architectural or design decisions the agent made}
  - **open_questions**: {unresolved items the next wave should address, or "None"}
  - **conventions_established**: {patterns set that subsequent agents must follow, or "None"}

  ## Requirements Covered
  {List the requirement IDs from the plan's frontmatter}
  - {REQ-ID}: {brief description}

  ---

  For FAILED plans, also include:

  ## Error Details
  {Full error output from the agent. Do not truncate — this is used for diagnosis
   in /legion:review. Include: error messages, stack traces if available, which
   task failed, what the state of the filesystem is (what was partially completed).}

Step 4: Confirm summary file was written
  - Verify the file exists at the expected path
  - If write failed: report error to orchestrator — the summary file is required
    for the wave completion check in Wave Execution Step 2
```

### Phase Decision Summary (decision_capture)

After all per-plan SUMMARY.md files are written for a phase, produce a phase-level decision summary appended to the final wave's completion report:

```markdown
### Phase Decision Summary

| Plan | Agent | Confidence | Adapter | Model Tier | Escalations |
|------|-------|------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| 01 | {agent-id} | {HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW} | {adapter} | {tier} | {count or "none"} |
| 02 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Escalations are decisions where an agent encountered an out-of-scope action and
documented it per the authority matrix escalation protocol.
```

This summary is reconstructed from the individual SUMMARY.md files' Agent Selection Rationale sections. If a plan was autonomous, its row shows "Autonomous" for Agent and dashes for Confidence/Adapter/Model Tier.

### Summary File Naming

Summary files follow the Plan File Convention from `workflow-common.md`:

```
.planning/phases/{NN-name}/{NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md
```

Examples:
- `.planning/phases/04-parallel-execution/04-01-SUMMARY.md`
- `.planning/phases/04-parallel-execution/04-02-SUMMARY.md`

The presence of a SUMMARY.md file is the signal used in Section 4, Step 2 to verify that a dependency plan completed. A failed plan still gets a SUMMARY.md (with Status: Failed) so that the dependency check correctly identifies and blocks dependent waves.

---

## Section 5.5: Escalation Detection & Routing

After each agent completes a task, scan its output for `<escalation>` blocks and route them according to the escalation protocol defined in `.planning/config/escalation-protocol.yaml`.

### Step 1: Detect Escalation Blocks

```
After receiving an agent's completion report (Section 5, Step 1):

1. Scan the full agent output text for <escalation> ... </escalation> blocks
2. For each escalation block found:
   a. Parse the YAML-formatted content inside the block tags
   b. Extract required fields: severity, type, decision, context
   c. Extract optional fields if present: alternatives, affected_files, related_domain
3. Validate each escalation block:
   - All 4 required fields must be present
   - severity must be one of: info | warning | blocker
   - type must be one of: architecture | dependency | scope | schema | api | deletion | infrastructure | quality
   - If any required field is missing or invalid, treat the escalation as severity: warning
     and append a note: "Malformed escalation block — defaulted to warning severity"
4. Collect all parsed escalation blocks into an escalation_list for this agent
```

### Step 2: Apply Control Mode Override

```
Before routing escalations, check the current control_mode profile
(resolved by workflow-common-core Settings Resolution Protocol):

1. Read the effective control_mode from the resolved settings profile
2. Apply control_mode_behaviors from escalation-protocol.yaml:

   autonomous mode:
     - Override ALL escalation severities to "info"
     - Agent proceeds with the action — escalations are logged only
     - No user prompts, no task halting

   guarded mode (default):
     - Use declared severity as-is — no override
     - Route according to severity_levels routing rules

   advisory mode:
     - Override ALL escalation severities to "info"
     - Agents are read-only so nothing to halt
     - Log all escalations for informational review

   surgical mode:
     - Use declared severity as-is, but floor is "warning" (never downgrade to info)
     - Auto-generate blocker escalation_block for any file access not in plan files_modified:
       severity: blocker
       type: scope
       decision: "Agent attempted to modify {file_path} which is not in files_modified."
       context: "Surgical mode requires all file modifications to be pre-approved in the plan. This file was not listed."
     - This auto-escalation happens even without an explicit <escalation> block from the agent

3. Store the effective severity (after override) on each escalation_block
```

### Step 3: Route Escalations by Severity

```
For each escalation_block in the escalation_list (using effective severity after control mode override):

  info:
    1. Append to SUMMARY.md Escalations table with status: "logged"
    2. Continue to next escalation or next agent — no interruption

  warning:
    1. Append to SUMMARY.md Escalations table with status: "logged"
    2. Display escalation to orchestrator output with highlight:
       "[ESCALATION WARNING] {type}: {decision}"
    3. Continue to next escalation or next agent — no interruption

  blocker:
    1. Append to SUMMARY.md Escalations table with status: "pending"
    2. Display full escalation details to user:

       ## Escalation: {type}
       **Severity**: BLOCKER
       **Agent**: {agent_id}
       **Decision needed**: {decision}
       **Context**: {context}
       **Alternatives**: {alternatives, if provided}
       **Affected files**: {affected_files, if provided}

    3. Prompt user via adapter.ask_user:
       "How would you like to proceed? [A]pprove / [R]eject / [D]efer"

    4. Record resolution:
       - Approve: Update SUMMARY.md escalation status to "approved",
         note what was approved. Agent may proceed with the action if
         re-executed (blocker escalations do not auto-retry — the approved
         action is recorded for reference in subsequent builds).
         If the blocked task could not complete, mark the plan as
         "Complete with Warnings" and inform the user they must re-run
         `/legion:build` to execute the approved action.
       - Reject: Update SUMMARY.md escalation status to "rejected",
         note the rejection reason. Agent must find an alternative approach
         within its authorized scope.
       - Defer: Update SUMMARY.md escalation status to "deferred",
         note deferral rationale. Task remains incomplete — tracked for
         future phase resolution.
```

### Step 4: Aggregate Escalation Counts

```
After processing all escalation_blocks for all agents in a wave:

1. Count escalations by severity and type across all agents
2. Include escalation counts in the Phase Decision Summary table (Section 5):
   - "Escalations" column shows: "{blocker_count}B / {warning_count}W / {info_count}I"
   - If no escalations: show "none"
3. If any blocker escalations were rejected or deferred:
   - Flag the affected plan as "Complete with Warnings" (not "Complete")
   - Include rejected/deferred escalation details in the Issues Encountered section
```

### Escalation Detection Algorithm (pseudocode)

```python
def detect_and_route_escalations(agent_output, agent_id, control_mode, plan_files_modified):
    """
    Scan agent output for escalation blocks and route by severity.
    Called after each agent completes (Section 5, Step 1).
    """
    escalation_list = []

    # Step 1: Parse escalation blocks from agent output
    escalation_blocks = extract_blocks(agent_output, tag="escalation")

    for block in escalation_blocks:
        parsed = parse_yaml(block.content)

        # Validate required fields
        required = ["severity", "type", "decision", "context"]
        if not all(f in parsed for f in required):
            parsed["severity"] = "warning"
            parsed["_note"] = "Malformed escalation block - defaulted to warning"

        valid_severities = ["info", "warning", "blocker"]
        if parsed.get("severity") not in valid_severities:
            parsed["severity"] = "warning"

        escalation_list.append(parsed)

    # Step 1b: Surgical mode auto-escalation for out-of-scope files
    if control_mode == "surgical":
        modified_files = extract_modified_files(agent_output)
        for file_path in modified_files:
            if file_path not in plan_files_modified:
                escalation_list.append({
                    "severity": "blocker",
                    "type": "scope",
                    "decision": f"Agent modified {file_path} not in files_modified",
                    "context": "Surgical mode file scope violation",
                    "_auto_generated": True
                })

    # Step 2: Apply control mode severity override
    for escalation_block in escalation_list:
        if control_mode == "autonomous" or control_mode == "advisory":
            escalation_block["effective_severity"] = "info"
        elif control_mode == "surgical":
            if escalation_block["severity"] == "info":

            else:
                escalation_block["effective_severity"] = escalation_block["severity"]
        else:  # guarded (default)
            escalation_block["effective_severity"] = escalation_block["severity"]

    # Step 3: Route by effective severity
    for escalation_block in escalation_list:

## Section 5.6: Handoff Context Injection

When dispatching Wave 2+ agents, the wave executor compiles and injects structured handoff context from prior waves. This enables forward-only information flow between agents without runtime messaging.

Protocol defined in `.planning/config/agent-communication.yaml`.

### Step 1: Agent Discovery Context (All Waves)

Before spawning each agent (regardless of wave), compile discovery context and inject it into the agent's prompt after personality injection (Section 3) and before task instructions:

```
For each plan being dispatched:

1. Compile discovery context:
   - current_wave: "Wave {N} of {total_waves}"
   - wave_agents: list of other agent-ids executing in the same wave (parallel peers)
     - Format: "{agent-id} (Plan {NN}-{PP})" for each peer
     - If solo: "solo"
   - prior_wave_agents: list of agent-ids that executed in earlier waves
     - Format: "{agent-id} (Plan {NN}-{PP})" for each prior agent
     - If Wave 1: "None (first wave)"
   - own_domains: agent's exclusive_domains from authority-matrix.yaml

2. Inject discovery context into agent prompt:

   ## Execution Context
   - Wave: {N} of {total_waves}
   - Parallel peers: {wave_agents or "solo"}
   - Prior wave: {prior_wave_agents or "None (first wave)"}
   - Your domains: {comma-separated domain list}

3. This block is injected AFTER the agent personality and BEFORE
   any handoff context or task instructions.
```

### Step 2: Compile Handoff Context (Wave 2+ Only)

```
When dispatching a plan in Wave 2 or later:

1. Identify dependency summaries:
   a. Read the plan's frontmatter depends_on list
   b. For each dependency, locate its SUMMARY.md:
      - Path: .planning/phases/{phase-dir}/{NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md
   c. If a dependency SUMMARY.md does not exist:
      - Log warning: "Dependency {NN}-{PP} SUMMARY.md not found for plan {current-plan}"
      - Continue without that dependency's handoff context
      - The agent will operate with incomplete context (graceful degradation)

2. Extract handoff context from each dependency SUMMARY.md:
   a. Parse the "## Handoff Context" section
   b. Extract fields: key_outputs, decisions_made, open_questions, conventions_established
   c. If the Handoff Context section is missing or malformed:
      - Fall back to extracting "## Files Modified" and "## Completed Tasks" as minimal context
      - Log warning: "SUMMARY.md for {NN}-{PP} missing Handoff Context section — using minimal handoff"

3. Extract pending escalations from each dependency SUMMARY.md:
   a. Parse the "## Escalations" section (if present)
   b. Filter for escalations with status: pending or deferred
   c. Collect these as escalations_pending for downstream injection

4. Compile the handoff briefing:
   - Merge handoff context from all dependencies
   - Group by source plan for clarity
   - Append any pending escalations as a separate section
```

### Step 3: Inject Handoff Context into Agent Prompt

```
After compiling the handoff briefing (Step 2), inject it into the
agent's spawn prompt between the discovery context and task instructions:

## Handoff Context from Prior Wave

### From Plan {NN}-{PP}: {plan title}
**Key outputs**: {key_outputs}
**Decisions made**: {decisions_made}
**Open questions**: {open_questions}
**Conventions established**: {conventions_established}

{Repeat for each dependency plan}

{If escalations_pending is non-empty:}
### Pending Escalations
The following escalations from prior waves remain unresolved:
| Severity | Type | Decision | Status |
|----------|------|----------|--------|
| {severity} | {type} | {decision} | {status} |

{If no handoff context available (all dependencies missing):}
## Handoff Context from Prior Wave
No handoff context available from prior waves. Proceed with task instructions.
```

### Handoff Injection Algorithm (pseudocode)

```python
def compile_and_inject_handoff(plan, phase_dir, wave_number):
    """
    Compile handoff context from dependency plans and inject into agent prompt.
    Called during agent dispatch for Wave 2+ plans.
    """
    if wave_number <= 1 and not plan.depends_on:
        return ""  # No handoff needed for Wave 1 without explicit dependencies

    handoff_sections = []
    pending_escalations = []

    for dep_id in plan.depends_on:
        summary_path = f"{phase_dir}/{dep_id}-SUMMARY.md"
        if not file_exists(summary_path):
            log_warning(f"Dependency {dep_id} SUMMARY.md not found for plan {plan.id}")
            continue

        summary_content = read_file(summary_path)

        # Extract handoff context section
        handoff = extract_section(summary_content, "## Handoff Context")
        if handoff:
            handoff_sections.append({
                "plan_id": dep_id,
                "title": extract_plan_title(summary_content),
                "context": handoff
            })
        else:
            # Graceful fallback: use Files Modified + Completed Tasks
            minimal = extract_minimal_handoff(summary_content)
            handoff_sections.append({
                "plan_id": dep_id,
                "title": extract_plan_title(summary_content),
                "context": minimal,
                "_fallback": True
            })

        # Extract pending escalations
        escalations = extract_section(summary_content, "## Escalations")
        if escalations:
            pending = filter_escalations(escalations, statuses=["pending", "deferred"])
            pending_escalations.extend(pending)

    return format_handoff_briefing(handoff_sections, pending_escalations)
```

---

## Section 5.7: SUMMARY.md Export Validation

After each plan completes and its SUMMARY.md is written, validate that the file conforms to the export standard defined in `.planning/config/agent-communication.yaml`.

### Validation Protocol

```
After a plan's SUMMARY.md is written (Section 5, after result collection):

1. Read the SUMMARY.md file that the agent produced

2. Check for required sections (all must be present):
   - "## Completed Tasks"
   - "## Files Modified"
   - "## Handoff Context"
   - "## Verification Results"

3. For each missing required section:
   - Log advisory warning:
     "[SUMMARY VALIDATION] Plan {NN}-{PP}: missing required section '{section_name}'"
   - This is advisory, NOT blocking — the plan is not failed for missing sections
   - Missing sections degrade handoff quality but do not halt execution

4. Check for conditional sections when applicable:
   - If agent output contained <escalation> blocks but SUMMARY.md has no "## Escalations":
     Log: "[SUMMARY VALIDATION] Plan {NN}-{PP}: escalation blocks detected but no Escalations section"

5. Report validation results in wave completion output:
   - "SUMMARY.md validation: {plan_id} — {pass_count}/{total} required sections present"

Rationale: This maintains Legion's "degrade gracefully" principle.
A missing handoff section means downstream agents get less context,
but execution is never blocked by incomplete documentation.
```

### Wave Transition Logging

```
At each wave boundary (after all plans in a wave complete, before starting next wave):

1. Log wave completion summary to build output:

   === Wave {N} Complete ===
   Plans completed: {count} ({list of plan IDs})
   Plans failed: {count} ({list of plan IDs, or "none"})
   Handoff context available: {count} plans with valid Handoff Context sections
   Pending escalations carried forward: {count} ({or "none"})

2. If proceeding to next wave:
   - Log: "Advancing to Wave {N+1} with handoff context from {count} prior plans"
   - List each prior plan and its handoff status (full / minimal / missing)

3. If stopping after wave (due to failures or final wave):
   - Log: "Wave execution complete. Final wave: {N} of {total_waves}"
   - Include aggregate handoff summary for post-build review
```

## Section 6: Error Scenarios

How to handle common failure modes without retrying or hiding problems.

```
1. AGENT SPAWN FAILURE
   Symptom: The Agent tool call itself returns an error (model unavailable,
            invalid parameters, context too large, team_name invalid, etc.)
   Action:
   - Mark the plan as failed in the wave results
   - Call TaskUpdate to mark the plan's task as failed (if task was created)
   - Capture the tool error message
   - Write a SUMMARY.md with Status: Failed and the spawn error details
   - Continue executing other plans in the same wave that haven't failed
   - After wave collection, apply post-wave decision logic (Section 4, Step 7)
   Example errors:
   - "Failed to spawn agent for plan 04-01: model sonnet unavailable"
   - "Failed to spawn agent for plan 04-01: team 'phase-04-execution' not found"

2. AGENT TIMEOUT / CONTEXT OVERFLOW
   Symptom: Agent runs but produces incomplete output; context limit reached
   Action:
   - Capture whatever output the agent produced before stopping
   - Treat as a failure — do not try to resume the agent
   - Write SUMMARY.md with Status: Failed and note: "Agent context limit reached.
     The plan may need to be split into smaller tasks."
   - Include partial output in Error Details for diagnosis

3. VERIFICATION FAILURE
   Symptom: Agent completes all tasks but verify commands produce unexpected results
            (file missing, grep finds wrong content, line count too low, etc.)
   Action:
   - Do NOT mark as hard failure — agent completed its work
   - Status: Complete with Warnings
   - Include the failing verify outputs in the Verification Results section
   - Note in Issues Encountered: "Verify step N returned unexpected result: {output}"
   - The plan is not retried; /legion:review will assess whether it's acceptable

4. FILE MODIFICATION CONFLICT (same-wave file collision)
   Symptom: Two plans in the same wave have overlapping files_modified entries
   Detection: During plan discovery (Section 2, Step 5d)
   Action:
   - Do NOT abort — continue execution with a warning
   - Log: "Warning: plans {NN}-{PP} and {NN}-{PP2} both modify {file path}.
     The second agent's changes will overwrite the first. Review the phase plan."
   - In the wave completion report, flag the conflict explicitly
   - Suggest the user re-plan the phase to move one plan to a later wave

5. MISSING PERSONALITY FILE
   Symptom: The agent .md file does not exist at {AGENTS_DIR}/{agent-id}.md
   Action:
   - Fall back to autonomous execution — run the plan without personality injection
   - Log: "Warning: personality file not found for {agent-id} at {expected-path}.
     Executing plan {NN}-{PP} as autonomous (no personality injection)."
   - In the plan SUMMARY.md, note the fallback under Issues Encountered
   - Do NOT fail the plan because of a missing personality file

6. NO PLANS FOUND
   Symptom: The phase directory exists but contains no {NN}-{PP}-PLAN.md files
   Action:
   - Error immediately — do not attempt execution
   - Message: "No plans found for Phase {N} in .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/.
     Run /legion:plan {N} first to generate plan files."
   - Suggest: check if the phase directory name matches STATE.md's current phase

7. PARTIAL WAVE FAILURE (some plans succeed, some fail)
   Symptom: A wave with multiple plans has a mix of successes and failures
   Action:
   - Write SUMMARY.md files for ALL plans in the wave (both succeeded and failed)
   - Collect and report all results before making the post-wave stop decision
   - Stop after the wave — do not proceed to the next wave even if most plans succeeded
   - Report clearly: "Wave {N}: {X} of {Y} plans succeeded. Stopping before Wave {N+1}.
     Failed plans: {list}."
   - This prevents later waves from building on a broken foundation

8. PHASE ALREADY PARTIALLY EXECUTED
   Symptom: Some SUMMARY.md files already exist for plans in the phase
   Detection: During plan discovery
   Action:
   - Report the already-completed plans: "Found {count} existing summaries.
     The following plans have already been executed: {list}"
   - Ask user: "Re-run all plans (including completed ones), or skip to
     incomplete plans only?"
   - If skip: filter the wave map to exclude plans with existing SUMMARY.md files
   - If re-run: delete existing SUMMARY.md files and execute all plans fresh

9. AGENT COMPLETES BUT DOESN'T REPORT
   Symptom: An agent goes idle without reporting results per adapter.collect_results.
            The agent may have completed its work but forgot the Reporting Results step.
   Detection: Agent appears idle but no completion report was received per adapter protocol.
   Action:
   - Follow up per adapter protocol: send a message asking for the structured summary
     with Status, Files, Verification, Decisions, Issues, and Errors fields.
   - Wait for the agent's response
   - If the agent still doesn't respond: infer the result from the filesystem
     - Check if the plan's files_modified list has been created/updated
     - Run the plan's <verification> commands manually
     - Write the SUMMARY.md based on filesystem evidence
     - Mark Status as "Complete with Warnings" and note: "Agent did not send
       completion message — result inferred from filesystem."
```

## Section 7: Two-Wave Pattern

Enhanced execution model with distinct Build/Analysis and Execution waves for maximum parallelism.

### Wave Pattern Overview

```
Wave A: Build + Analysis (Parallel)
├── Plan A1: Build service/page group 1 (e.g., frontend components)
├── Plan A2: Build service/page group 2 (e.g., backend API)
├── Plan A3: Analyze architecture (backend-architect reviews A1, A2 outputs)
└── Plan A4: Security audit (security-engineer reviews A1, A2 outputs)

[Gate: Architecture Review Complete]

Wave B: Execution + Remediation (Parallel)
├── Plan B1: Execute tests against Wave A outputs
├── Plan B2: Performance benchmark
├── Plan B3: SRE chaos testing (parallel to validation)
└── Plan B4: Data scientist validation (parallel to remediation)

[Gate: Production Readiness]
```

### Two-Wave Plan Structure

Plans in two-wave mode have extended frontmatter:

```yaml
---
phase: XX-name
plan: NN
type: execute
wave: A | B                    # Wave A or Wave B
depends_on: []                 # Can depend on other wave plans
wave_a_outputs: []             # For Wave B plans: which Wave A plans produced inputs
wave_role: build | analysis | execution | remediation
authority_scope: []            # Domains this plan touches
---
```

### Wave A Execution

**Step 1: Dynamic agent spawning per service group**
- Parse plans for service/page group identifiers
- Group plans by service: all plans touching "auth-service" spawn together
- Within service group: build plans run parallel with analysis plans
- Cross-service: independent services run in parallel

**Step 2: Authority-aware parallel composition**
- When spawning multiple agents in Wave A:
  - Build agents get full personality injection
  - Analysis agents get read-only context of build outputs
  - Security and architecture agents are spawned last (review position)

**Step 3: Wave A output collection**
- Collect all SUMMARY.md files
- Build aggregate outputs manifest: `{service: {files: [], status: complete|failed}}`
- Pass manifest to Wave B via dependency tracking

### Wave B Execution

**Step 1: Dependency validation**
- Verify all Wave A outputs referenced in `wave_a_outputs` have SUMMARY.md
- If any Wave A plan failed: skip Wave B, report "Wave A incomplete"

**Step 2: Parallel execution and remediation**
- Tests, benchmarks, and validation run in parallel (standard wave execution)
- Remediation agents (SRE chaos, data scientist) also run parallel
- Both streams produce findings independently

**Step 3: Finding synthesis**
- Test findings + chaos findings → consolidated validation report
- If validation fails: remediation recommendations from chaos/data scientist
- User decides: fix and re-run Wave B, or accept risks

### Gates Between Waves

Three checkpoint types between Wave A and Wave B:

1. **Requirements Gate** (implicit in plan dependencies)
   - All Wave A `depends_on` satisfied
   - Automatically enforced by wave executor

2. **Architecture Gate** (optional checkpoint)
   - If phase has `architecture_review: true` in CONTEXT.md:
   - Pause after Wave A
   - Prompt user: "Wave A complete. Architecture findings:
     - {architecture-agent} recommends: {findings}
     - Proceed to Wave B, or revise Wave A outputs?"

3. **Production Readiness Gate** (after Wave B)
   - Review panel synthesis from Wave B
   - Verdict: PASS, NEEDS_WORK, or FAIL
   - FAIL blocks phase completion

### Two-Wave Activation

Two-wave pattern activates when:
- Phase plan count >= 4 (needs enough work to parallelize)
- Plans span multiple service/page groups OR include explicit analysis tasks
- `two_wave: true` in phase CONTEXT.md (optional override)

Standard single-wave execution when:
- Phase has < 4 plans
- All plans touch same files (no parallelization benefit)
- `two_wave: false` in phase CONTEXT.md

This skill implements patterns defined in `workflow-common.md`:

| Pattern | Source Section | Used In |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Personality Injection Pattern | workflow-common.md — Personality Injection Pattern | Section 3 |
| Wave Execution Pattern | workflow-common.md — Wave Execution Pattern | Section 4 |
| Cost Profile Convention | workflow-common.md — Cost Profile Convention | Section 1 (Sonnet for execution) |

| State Update Pattern | workflow-common.md — State Update Pattern | Section 4, Step 8 |

Agent file paths are resolved using the `agent-registry.md` Agent Catalog (Section 1), which maps every agent ID to its file path.

### Quick Reference: Agent Path Format

```
{AGENTS_DIR}/{agent-id}.md

Examples:
  {AGENTS_DIR}/engineering-senior-developer.md
  {AGENTS_DIR}/testing-evidence-collector.md
  {AGENTS_DIR}/design-ux-architect.md
  {AGENTS_DIR}/agents-orchestrator.md

AGENTS_DIR is resolved once per command via workflow-common Agent Path Resolution Protocol.
```

If an agent-id is ambiguous, check agent-registry.md Section 1 for the canonical file path.

## Section 6: INTENT-BASED PLAN FILTERING

When build command detects filter_plans mode intents (--just-document, --skip-frontend, etc.), apply filtering before wave execution.

### 6.1 Filter Predicates

**Agent-based filter:**
```javascript
function createAgentFilter(excludeAgents) {
  return (plan) => {
    const planAgent = extractAssignedAgent(plan);
    return !excludeAgents.includes(planAgent);
  };
}
```

**File-based filter:**
```javascript
function createFileFilter(patterns) {
  return (plan) => {
    const files = plan.frontmatter.files_modified || [];
    return !files.some(file => 
      patterns.some(pattern => minimatch(file, pattern))
    );
  };
}
```

**Task-type filter:**
```javascript
function createTaskFilter(includeTypes, excludeTypes) {
  return (plan) => {
    const planTypes = detectTaskTypes(plan.content);
    
    if (includeTypes && !planTypes.some(t => includeTypes.includes(t))) {
      return false;
    }
    
    if (excludeTypes && planTypes.some(t => excludeTypes.includes(t))) {
      return false;
    }
    
    return true;
  };
}
```

### 6.2 Filter Execution

```markdown
## Step 3.5: APPLY INTENT FILTERS (conditional)

If intent flags with mode: "filter_plans" detected:

1. Load filter criteria from intent-teams.yaml
2. Build filter predicates:
   - Agent filters (exclude_agents)
   - File filters (exclude_file_patterns)
   - Task filters (include_task_types, exclude_task_types)

3. Apply filters:
   ```
   filteredPlans = allPlans.filter(plan => 
     agentFilter(plan) && 
     fileFilter(plan) && 
     taskFilter(plan)
   );
   ```

4. Validate results:
   - If filteredPlans.length === 0:
     - ERROR: "No plans remain after applying filters: {intents}"
     - SUGGEST: "This phase may be focused on excluded areas. Use /legion:plan to view all plans."
     - EXIT
   
   - If filteredPlans.length < allPlans.length:
     - LOG: "Filtered {original} plans → {filtered} plans"
     - LOG: "Excluded: {list of excluded plan names}"

5. Proceed with filteredPlans in Step 4 (Wave Execution)
```

### 6.3 Task Type Detection

Detect task types from plan content:
- Parse objective and tasks sections
- Match keywords against intent-teams.yaml task_types taxonomy
- Cache results for performance

This enables INTENT-02 (--just-document) and INTENT-03 (--skip-frontend) by filtering plans before execution.

## Section 10: File Placement Utilities (ENV-04)

Helper functions for validating file placement against directory mappings.

> **Note**: These utilities mirror the path enforcement logic in spec-pipeline
> Section 8, but operate at execution time rather than specification time.

### 10.1: File Category Inference

Determine the expected directory category from a file path:

```
inferFileCategory(filePath):
  # Extract file name and extension
  fileName = basename(filePath)
  fileExt = extname(filePath)
  fileDir = dirname(filePath)
  
  # Test patterns (highest priority)
  if matches(fileName, "*.test.*") or matches(fileName, "*.spec.*"):
    return "tests"
  
  # Directory-based categories
  if matches(fileDir, "**/routes/**") or matches(fileDir, "**/api/**"):
    return "routes"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/components/**") or matches(fileDir, "**/ui/**"):
    return "components"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/services/**"):
    return "services"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/utils/**") or matches(fileDir, "**/helpers/**") or matches(fileDir, "**/lib/**"):
    return "utils"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/types/**") or matches(fileDir, "**/interfaces/**"):
    return "types"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/config/**"):
    return "config"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/middleware/**") or matches(fileDir, "**/plugins/**"):
    return "middleware"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/public/**") or matches(fileDir, "**/assets/**") or matches(fileDir, "**/static/**"):
    return "assets"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/styles/**") or matches(fileDir, "**/css/**"):
    return "styles"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/hooks/**") or matches(fileDir, "**/composables/**"):
    return "hooks"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/stores/**") or matches(fileDir, "**/state/**"):
    return "stores"
  
  # Legion-specific categories
  if matches(fileDir, "**/commands/**"):
    return "commands"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/skills/**") and matches(fileName, "SKILL.md"):
    return "skills"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/agents/**"):
    return "agents"
  if matches(fileDir, "**/adapters/**"):
    return "adapters"
  
  # Default
  return "general"
```

### 10.2: Directory Validation

Check if a file is in an allowed directory for its category:

```
validateDirectory(filePath, category, mappings):
  # Get allowed paths for category
  categoryConfig = mappings.mappings[category]
  
  if not categoryConfig:
    # No mapping for this category - allow anywhere
    return { 
      valid: true, 
      note: "No directory mapping for category '{category}'" 
    }
  
  allowedPaths = categoryConfig.paths
  fileDir = dirname(filePath)
  
  # Check if fileDir matches or is a child of any allowed path
  for allowedPath in allowedPaths:
    if fileDir == allowedPath or fileDir.startsWith(allowedPath + "/"):
      return {
        valid: true,
        matchedPath: allowedPath,
        isNested: fileDir != allowedPath
      }
  
  # No match - violation
  primaryPath = allowedPaths[0]
  suggestedPath = join(primaryPath, basename(filePath))
  
  return {
    valid: false,
    currentDir: fileDir,
    allowedPaths: allowedPaths,
    suggestion: suggestedPath,
    category: category
  }
```

### 10.3: Validation Result Handler

Process validation results based on enforcement settings:

```
handleValidationResults(results, strictness, planId):
  violations = results.filter(r => !r.valid)
  warnings = results.filter(r => r.valid && r.warning)
  
  if violations.length == 0 and warnings.length == 0:
    return {
      action: "proceed",
      message: "All {results.length} files validated successfully ✓"
    }
  
  if strictness == "strict" and violations.length > 0:
    errorMessage = buildErrorMessage(violations, planId)
    return {
      action: "block",
      message: errorMessage,
      halt: true
    }
  
  if (strictness == "warn" and violations.length > 0) or warnings.length > 0:
    warningMessage = buildWarningMessage(violations, warnings, planId)
    return {
      action: "warn",
      message: warningMessage,
      halt: false
    }
  
  # strictness == "off"
  return {
    action: "proceed",
    message: "Validation disabled - {violations.length} violations noted but not enforced"
  }
```

### 10.4: Validation Report Format

Format validation results for wave reports:

```markdown
### File Placement Validation

**Status:** {All valid | {N} warnings | {N} violations}

| File | Category | Directory | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| {file} | {category} | {dir} | ✓ Valid |
| {file} | {category} | {dir} | ⚠️ Warning: Should be in {suggested} |
| {file} | {category} | {dir} | ❌ Violation: Must be in {allowed} |

{If violations present:}
**Required Actions:**
- Move files to correct directories, or
- Update directory mappings, or  
- Add path_override to plan frontmatter
```

### 10.5: Cross-Reference with Spec Pipeline

Integration points with spec-pipeline path enforcement:

| Stage | Tool | Validation | Action on Violation |
|-------|------|-----------|---------------------|
| Planning | spec-pipeline | Pre-execution | Warn/Block spec finalization |
| Execution | wave-executor | Pre-spawn | Warn/Block agent spawn |

**Consistency Rule**: Both tools use the same directory-mappings.yaml and follow
the same validation logic from spec-pipeline Section 8.
