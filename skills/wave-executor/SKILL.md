# Wave Executor

Engine for `/legion:build`. Takes the plan files in a phase directory and executes them in wave order — spawning personality-injected agents in parallel within each wave, waiting for completion before advancing to the next wave. The full flow: discover plans, validate structure, inject personalities, spawn parallel agents, collect results, write summaries, report.

---

## Section 1: Execution Principles

These rules govern all execution decisions. Do not deviate from them.

> **MANDATORY: Agent Teams are the ONLY execution method.**
>
> Every phase execution MUST use the full Claude Code Teams lifecycle:
> 1. `TeamCreate` — before any agents are spawned
> 2. `TaskCreate` — one task per plan, with cross-wave `addBlockedBy` dependencies
> 3. `Agent` with `team_name` — every agent spawn MUST include the `team_name` parameter
> 4. `SendMessage` — agents report results to the coordinator, coordinator communicates with agents
> 5. `SendMessage(type: "shutdown_request")` — graceful shutdown of all agents
> 6. `TeamDelete` — clean up after execution
>
> **Spawning agents without `team_name` is a violation of this skill.** Do not use bare
> subagents (Agent tool without team_name). If Teams are unavailable (e.g., the
> `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` setting is not enabled), stop and tell the
> user to enable it — do not silently fall back to subagents.
>
> This is not optional. This is not a suggestion. If you are about to call the Agent
> tool without `team_name`, STOP — you are skipping the coordination layer that makes
> wave execution, result collection, and lifecycle management work correctly.

1. **Wave-sequential, parallel-within** — all Wave 1 plans must complete before any Wave 2 plan begins. Within a wave, all plans run at the same time via a Claude Code Team.
2. **Full personality injection** — each agent receives the ENTIRE contents of its assigned personality `.md` file as system instructions. No summaries, no excerpts, no paraphrasing.
3. **Sonnet for execution** — all spawned agents use `model: "sonnet"`. This matches the Cost Profile Convention from `workflow-common.md`.
4. **No automatic retries** — if an agent fails, capture the error output and stop the wave. Report to the user. Do not re-spawn the failed agent. See Error Handling Pattern in `workflow-common.md`.
5. **Each plan produces a summary** — after an agent completes, write a `{NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md` file to the phase directory, whether the result is success or failure.
6. **Orchestrator stays in main context** — the `/legion:build` command itself does not execute plan work. It reads, validates, dispatches, and collects. Agents get fresh contexts.
7. **Failed wave blocks subsequent waves** — if any plan in a wave fails, do not proceed to the next wave. Report wave status and pause for user decision.
8. **Files isolation per wave** — plans within the same wave must not share files_modified entries. This is guaranteed by plan authoring (see phase-decomposer.md), but flag a warning if a conflict is detected.
9. **One Team per phase (mandatory)** — call `TeamCreate` once before any agents are spawned. One Team per phase, not per wave. Every `Agent` call MUST pass `team_name`. If you find yourself spawning an Agent without `team_name`, you are violating this skill — see the enforcement block above.
10. **Agents report via SendMessage** — spawned agents send their structured completion summary to the coordinator via SendMessage, not via Agent tool return. This keeps the coordinator's context window small (~200 tokens per agent instead of ~2000+).
11. **Verification-gated completion** — after each task, the agent MUST run all `> verification:` commands from the task's action block. If any verification command returns a non-zero exit code, the task is marked as failed and the agent must report the failure. Do not proceed to the next task until all verifications pass.

---

## Section 2: Plan Discovery

How to find, read, and organize plan files for a phase before any execution begins.

```
Step 1: Determine the phase directory path
  - Read .planning/STATE.md to find the current phase number and slug
  - Or accept a --phase argument from the build command
  - Construct the directory: .planning/phases/{NN}-{phase-slug}/
  - Example: .planning/phases/04-parallel-execution/

Step 2: List all files in the phase directory
  - Read directory contents
  - Filter for files matching: {NN}-{PP}-PLAN.md
  - Exclude: {NN}-CONTEXT.md, {NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md, and any other files
  - Sort plans by plan number (PP) ascending

Step 3: Read each plan file's YAML frontmatter
  For each plan file, parse the frontmatter block (between --- delimiters):
  - wave: integer (required — which execution wave this plan belongs to)
  - depends_on: list of "NN-PP" strings (plans that must complete before this one)
  - autonomous: boolean (true = no agent needed, false = agent-delegated)
  - files_modified: list of file paths this plan creates or modifies
  - requirements: list of requirement IDs covered by this plan
  Extract the plan's assigned agent from the plan content body if present
  (look for a line like: Agent: {agent-id} in the objective or context block)

Step 4: Build the wave map
  Construct a data structure grouping plans by wave number:
  {
    1: [plan-04-01, plan-04-02],   -- runs first, in parallel
    2: [plan-04-03],               -- runs after wave 1 completes
    3: [plan-04-04, plan-04-05],   -- runs after wave 2 completes
  }

Step 5: Validate the plan structure
  Check all of the following before proceeding:
  a) At least one plan file exists. If not: error "No plans found for Phase {N}.
     Run /legion:plan {N} first."
  b) All depends_on references point to plans in earlier (lower) waves. If a plan
     in wave 2 depends on another wave 2 plan: error "Circular wave dependency
     detected in plan {NN}-{PP}. Plans within the same wave cannot depend on
     each other. Re-run /legion:plan {N} to fix the plan structure."
  c) Each wave number is a positive integer with no gaps above wave 1 (wave 1
     always present; wave 3 allowed only if wave 2 exists).
  d) All files_modified lists are disjoint within each wave (no two plans in the
     same wave modify the same file). If a conflict is found: warn the user —
     do not abort, but flag for review.
  If validation fails on (a), (b), or (c): stop and report the error. Do not execute.

Step 6: Report discovery results
  Before executing, show a discovery summary:
  "Found {total} plans across {wave_count} waves:
   Wave 1: {plan names} ({count} plans)
   Wave 2: {plan names} ({count} plans)
   ..."
```

## Section 3: Personality Injection

How to load a full agent personality and construct the execution prompt for each plan.

```
For each plan where autonomous: false:

Step 1: Identify the assigned agent
  - Check the plan's <objective> or <context> block for "Agent: {agent-id}"
  - Cross-reference agent-id against agent-registry.md to confirm file path
  - Path format: {AGENTS_DIR}/{agent-id}.md  (AGENTS_DIR resolved via workflow-common Agent Path Resolution Protocol)
  - Example: {AGENTS_DIR}/engineering-senior-developer.md

Step 2: Read the complete personality file
  - Use the Read tool to load the ENTIRE agent .md file
  - Do not truncate, summarize, or excerpt any portion
  - The personality content includes: the agent's identity, specialization, behavioral
    traits, communication style, technical focus areas, and working principles
  - Capture this as: PERSONALITY_CONTENT

Step 3: Read the complete plan file
  - Use the Read tool to load the full plan .md file
  - Capture the section starting from <objective> through end of file as: PLAN_CONTENT

Step 3.5: Load brownfield context (optional)
  - Check if .planning/CODEBASE.md exists
  - If yes:
    a. Read .planning/CODEBASE.md
    b. Extract these sections:
       - "## Agent Guidance" → Preferred and Avoid directives
       - "## Conventions Detected" → all convention bullet points
       - "## Risk Areas" → filter to rows where the Area or file paths overlap
         with the current plan's files_modified list
    c. Compose a CODEBASE_CONTEXT block:

       ## Codebase Context

       ### Conventions
       {bullet list from Conventions Detected}

       ### Agent Guidance
       - **Preferred**: {from Agent Guidance}
       - **Avoid**: {from Agent Guidance}

       ### Risk Areas
       {filtered Risk Areas table rows, or "No risk areas overlap with this plan's files."}

  - If CODEBASE.md does not exist: set CODEBASE_CONTEXT = "" (empty string, no block injected)

Step 4: Construct the agent execution prompt
  Combine personality and plan using this exact format:

  """
  {PERSONALITY_CONTENT}

  ---

  # Execution Task

  You are executing a plan as part of Legion. Follow the tasks below precisely.

  {CODEBASE_CONTEXT}

  {PLAN_CONTENT}

  ## Important
  - Execute each task in the order listed
  - Run the <verify> commands after each task to confirm completion before moving on
  - CRITICAL: Extract all `> verification:` lines from each task's <action> block and run them as bash commands
  - Each `> verification:` line is a bash command that must return exit code 0
  - If ANY verification command fails (non-zero exit code):
    a. Record the failed command and its output
    b. Attempt to fix the issue (re-read the task, check your work)
    c. Re-run the failed verification
    d. If it still fails after one fix attempt: mark the task as FAILED in your summary
    e. Do NOT skip failed verifications or proceed to the next task
  - Run verifications in order — they may have implicit dependencies
  - After all tasks complete, run the full <verification> checklist
  - Do NOT modify files outside of the plan's files_modified list unless the task
    explicitly requires it (e.g., updating an import in a file that uses the new file)
  - If a task is ambiguous, apply your specialist expertise to resolve the ambiguity
    and document the decision in your summary

  ## Reporting Results
  When all tasks and verification are complete, you MUST:
  1. Use the SendMessage tool to send your structured summary to the coordinator:
     SendMessage(type: "message", recipient: "coordinator", summary: "Plan {NN}-{PP} complete", content: "...")
  2. Use TaskUpdate to mark your task as completed.

  Your SendMessage content MUST include these fields:
  - **Status**: Complete | Complete with Warnings | Failed
  - **Files**: list of files created/modified with brief descriptions
  - **Verification**: outputs from <verify> commands
  - **Verification Commands Run**: count of `> verification:` commands executed
  - **Verification Passed**: count that returned exit code 0
  - **Verification Failed**: count that returned non-zero, with command + output for each
  - **Decisions**: key implementation decisions made
  - **Issues**: any problems or warnings encountered (or "None")
  - **Errors**: error details if failed (or "None")
  """

Step 5: Spawn the agent via the Agent tool
  Parameters:
  - subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  - prompt: {constructed prompt from Step 4}
  - model: "sonnet"              -- cost profile: Sonnet for execution
  - name: "{agent-id}-{NN}-{PP}" -- e.g., "engineering-senior-developer-04-01"
  - team_name: "{phase_team_name}" -- e.g., "phase-04-execution"

For autonomous plans (autonomous: true):

  Step 1: Skip personality loading entirely

  Step 2: Read the complete plan file

  Step 3: Construct the autonomous execution prompt:
  """
  # Execution Task

  You are executing a plan as part of Legion. No specialist agent
  personality is needed for this plan — execute the tasks directly.

  {CODEBASE_CONTEXT}

  {PLAN_CONTENT}

  ## Important
  - Execute each task in the order listed
  - Run the <verify> commands after each task to confirm completion
  - CRITICAL: Extract all `> verification:` lines from each task's <action> block and run them as bash commands
  - Each `> verification:` line is a bash command that must return exit code 0
  - If ANY verification command fails (non-zero exit code):
    a. Record the failed command and its output
    b. Attempt to fix the issue (re-read the task, check your work)
    c. Re-run the failed verification
    d. If it still fails after one fix attempt: mark the task as FAILED in your summary
    e. Do NOT skip failed verifications or proceed to the next task
  - Run verifications in order — they may have implicit dependencies
  - After all tasks complete, run the full <verification> checklist

  ## Reporting Results
  When all tasks and verification are complete, you MUST:
  1. Use the SendMessage tool to send your structured summary to the coordinator:
     SendMessage(type: "message", recipient: "coordinator", summary: "Plan {NN}-{PP} complete", content: "...")
  2. Use TaskUpdate to mark your task as completed.

  Your SendMessage content MUST include these fields:
  - **Status**: Complete | Complete with Warnings | Failed
  - **Files**: list of files created/modified with brief descriptions
  - **Verification**: outputs from <verify> commands
  - **Verification Commands Run**: count of `> verification:` commands executed
  - **Verification Passed**: count that returned exit code 0
  - **Verification Failed**: count that returned non-zero, with command + output for each
  - **Decisions**: key implementation decisions made
  - **Issues**: any problems or warnings encountered (or "None")
  - **Errors**: error details if failed (or "None")
  """

  Step 4: Spawn the agent via the Agent tool
  Parameters:
  - subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  - prompt: {constructed autonomous prompt}
  - model: "sonnet"
  - name: "executor-{NN}-{PP}" -- e.g., "executor-04-01"
  - team_name: "{phase_team_name}" -- e.g., "phase-04-execution"
```

### Personality Loading Notes

- If the personality file does not exist at the expected path, fall back to autonomous execution (no personality). Log: "Warning: personality file not found for {agent-id} at {path}. Executing plan {NN}-{PP} without personality injection."
- The personality content may be 200-500 lines. This is expected and intentional — full injection is the core mechanism that gives agents their specialist behavior.
- Cross-reference agent-registry.md (Section 1: Agent Catalog) for the canonical file path when in doubt.

### Future Optimization: Selective Personality Loading

> **Note**: This documents a future optimization path. No behavioral change is implemented — full injection remains the current approach.

For agents over 300 lines, a future version could split personality into two tiers:

- **Core personality** (~100 lines, always injected): Identity & Memory, Core Mission, Critical Rules, Communication Style — the sections that shape the agent's voice, decision-making, and behavioral boundaries.
- **Extended sections** (loaded conditionally): Technical Deliverables (code templates, report templates, framework configs) — loaded only when the task type matches the template domain.

This would reduce context consumption for large agents (currently 600+ lines) during parallel wave execution, where multiple agents each receive full personality injection. The Wave 3 standardization effort (target: 100-350 lines per agent) is the immediate mitigation — trimming verbose code examples in the largest agents while expanding thin stubs.

## Section 4: Wave Execution

How to execute each wave in order, dispatching plans in parallel within each wave.

```
Step 0: Set up the phase Team (once, before the wave loop)
  - Call TeamCreate with team_name: "phase-{NN}-execution"
    (e.g., "phase-04-execution"). One Team per phase — not per wave.
  - Call TaskCreate for each plan in the phase:
    - subject: "Execute plan {NN}-{PP}: {plan_name}"
    - description: brief plan summary
  - Set cross-wave dependencies via TaskUpdate:
    - For each plan with depends_on references, call TaskUpdate with
      addBlockedBy pointing to the task IDs of the dependency plans
  - The coordinator is auto-registered as a Team member when TeamCreate is called.
    Use the coordinator's name consistently in agent prompt templates for SendMessage recipient.

For each wave number in ascending order (1, 2, 3, ...):

Step 1: Identify plans in the current wave
  - Filter the wave map for the current wave number
  - Collect: plan file paths, agent IDs, autonomous flags

Step 2: Pre-execution dependency check
  - For each plan in this wave, inspect depends_on list
  - Verify each referenced plan (e.g., "04-01") has a corresponding SUMMARY.md file
    in the phase directory (indicating completion)
  - If any dependency SUMMARY.md is missing or contains Status: Failed:
    - Skip the current wave entirely
    - Report: "Wave {N} skipped: dependency plan {NN}-{PP} did not complete
      successfully. Resolve the failure before retrying."
    - Stop execution

Step 3: Construct agent prompts for all plans in the wave
  - For each plan, run the Personality Injection flow from Section 3
  - Prepare all prompts before spawning any agents

Step 4: Spawn agents in parallel via the Team
  - For a SINGLE plan in the wave:
    - Spawn one agent via the Agent tool with team_name: "{phase_team_name}"
  - For MULTIPLE plans in the wave:
    - Issue ALL Agent tool calls in a SINGLE message response
    - Each Agent call MUST include team_name: "{phase_team_name}"
    - This maximizes parallelism — Claude Code will run them concurrently
    - Do NOT spawn agents one at a time for multi-plan waves
    - Each agent gets its own fully-constructed prompt (personality + plan)
    - Agents in the same wave are fully independent — they share no state or
      communication during execution

Step 5: Collect agent results via SendMessage
  - Wait for every agent in the wave to send its completion message via SendMessage
  - Each agent's SendMessage contains a structured summary with Status, Files,
    Verification, Decisions, Issues, and Errors fields
  - Track: which plans succeeded (Status: Complete), which failed (Status: Failed),
    what files were modified (from the Files field)
  - If an agent goes idle without sending a message, send a follow-up message
    asking for status. If still no response, check the filesystem for partial work.

Step 6: Process wave results
  - For each completed agent, run the Agent Result Processing flow (Section 5)
    to generate the SUMMARY.md file
  - Compile the wave completion report:
    Completed: [list of plan names that succeeded]
    Failed: [list of plan names that failed, with error summaries]
    Files modified: [aggregate list across all plans in the wave]

Step 7: Post-wave decision
  - If ALL plans in the wave completed successfully:
    - Report wave success
    - Proceed to the next wave
  - If ANY plan in the wave failed:
    - Report wave failure with the full list of failed plans and errors
    - STOP — do not proceed to subsequent waves
    - Instruct the user: "Wave {N} had {count} failure(s). Fix the issue and
      re-run /legion:build, or run /legion:review for diagnosis."

Step 8: After all waves complete
  - Report full execution summary: total plans, total waves, files modified
  - Update .planning/STATE.md: mark phase as complete, record completion timestamp
  - Suggest next action: "/legion:review to validate the phase output"

Step 9: Shutdown the Team
  - Send shutdown_request via SendMessage to every agent spawned during the phase:
    SendMessage(type: "shutdown_request", recipient: "{agent-name}", content: "Phase execution complete")
  - Wait for shutdown confirmations
  - Call TeamDelete to clean up the Team configuration
  - This step runs on BOTH success and failure paths — never leave orphaned agents
    or stale Team configs behind
```

### Parallelism Implementation via Claude Code Teams

The full Teams lifecycle for parallel execution:

1. **TeamCreate** (once per phase, in Step 0):
   ```
   TeamCreate(team_name: "phase-04-execution", description: "Phase 4: Parallel Execution")
   ```

2. **TaskCreate** (one per plan, in Step 0):
   ```
   TaskCreate(subject: "Execute plan 04-01: wave-executor skill", ...)
   TaskCreate(subject: "Execute plan 04-02: execution-tracker skill", ...)
   TaskCreate(subject: "Execute plan 04-03: build command", ...)
   TaskUpdate(taskId: "3", addBlockedBy: ["1", "2"])  -- wave 2 depends on wave 1
   ```

3. **Spawn with team_name** (per wave, in Step 4):
   ```
   [In a single response, issue all Agent tool calls for the wave:]
   Agent(name="engineering-senior-developer-04-01", prompt="...", model="sonnet", team_name="phase-04-execution")
   Agent(name="executor-04-02", prompt="...", model="sonnet", team_name="phase-04-execution")
   ```

4. **Collect via SendMessage** (per wave, in Step 5):
   Each agent sends a structured summary via SendMessage to the coordinator.
   The coordinator receives ~200 tokens per agent instead of the full ~2000+ execution trace.
   Wait for all agents in the wave before advancing.

5. **Shutdown + TeamDelete** (once per phase, in Step 9):
   ```
   SendMessage(type: "shutdown_request", recipient: "engineering-senior-developer-04-01", content: "Phase complete")
   SendMessage(type: "shutdown_request", recipient: "executor-04-02", content: "Phase complete")
   SendMessage(type: "shutdown_request", recipient: "design-ux-architect-04-03", content: "Phase complete")
   TeamDelete()
   ```

All Team members in a wave run concurrently. The orchestrator waits until all agents send their SendMessage summaries before writing SUMMARY.md files or advancing to the next wave. Within the Team, agents share no state — each operates on its own plan in its own fresh context.

---

## Section 5: Agent Result Processing

How to interpret what each agent returns and write the plan summary file.

```
For each completed agent (success or failure):

Step 1: Parse the agent's SendMessage content
  The agent's SendMessage contains a structured summary with these fields:
  - **Status**: Complete | Complete with Warnings | Failed
  - **Files**: list of files created/modified with brief descriptions
  - **Verification**: outputs from <verify> commands
  - **Verification Commands Run**: count of `> verification:` commands executed
  - **Verification Passed**: count that returned exit code 0
  - **Verification Failed**: count that returned non-zero, with command + output for each
  - **Decisions**: key implementation decisions made
  - **Issues**: any problems or warnings encountered
  - **Errors**: error details if failed

  Use the Status field directly to determine the result:
  - "Complete" → SUCCESS
  - "Complete with Warnings" → COMPLETE WITH WARNINGS
  - "Failed" → FAILED
  If the Status field is missing or ambiguous, fall back to parsing for signals:
  - SUCCESS indicators: "verification passed", "complete", all verify commands ran
  - FAILURE indicators: "error:", "failed:", "could not", "exception"

Step 2: Determine result status
  - SUCCESS: agent completed all tasks, ALL verification commands passed (exit code 0)
  - COMPLETE WITH WARNINGS: agent completed tasks but some non-critical verify steps had issues
    (e.g., line count slightly below expected but content is correct)
  - FAILED: agent could not complete one or more tasks, OR any `> verification:` command
    returned non-zero exit code and the agent could not fix it after one attempt

  IMPORTANT: Verification failure is a hard gate. Unlike `<verify>` block outputs which
  are advisory, `> verification:` command failures block plan completion. A plan with
  any failed verification command MUST have Status: Failed or Status: Complete with Warnings
  (never Status: Complete).

Step 3: Generate the plan summary file
  Path: .planning/phases/{NN}-{phase-slug}/{NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md

  Write the file using this format:

  ---

  # Plan {NN}-{PP} Summary: {plan_name}

  ## Result
  **Status**: Complete | Complete with Warnings | Failed
  **Wave**: {wave_number}
  **Agent**: {agent-id} | Autonomous
  **Completed**: {timestamp}

  ## What Was Done
  {Summary of actions taken, derived from the agent's return message.
   Should be specific: "Created skills/wave-executor/SKILL.md (312 lines)
   with 6 sections covering plan discovery, personality injection, wave execution,
   result processing, and error handling."}

  ## Files Created / Modified
  - {file path 1} — {brief description of what changed}
  - {file path 2} — {brief description of what changed}

  ## Verification Results
  {Output from the plan's verification steps, as reported by the agent.
   Include actual command outputs where available.}

  ## Verification Commands
  | Command | Exit Code | Result |
  |---------|-----------|--------|
  | `test -f path/to/file.md` | 0 | PASS |
  | `grep -q "Section 1:" path/to/file.md` | 0 | PASS |
  | `wc -l < path/to/file.md \| xargs test 50 -le` | 1 | FAIL — file has 42 lines |

  ## Key Decisions
  {Notable implementation decisions, ambiguities resolved, approaches chosen.
   If none: "No significant decisions — followed plan as written."}

  ## Issues Encountered
  {Any problems, deviations, or warnings. If none: "None."}

  ## Requirements Covered
  {List the requirement IDs from the plan's frontmatter}
  - {REQ-ID}: {brief description}

  ---

  For FAILED plans, also include:

  ## Error Details
  {Full error output from the agent. Do not truncate — this is used for diagnosis
   in /legion:review. Include: error messages, stack traces if available, which
   task failed, what the state of the filesystem is (what was partially completed).}

Step 4: Confirm summary file was written
  - Verify the file exists at the expected path
  - If write failed: report error to orchestrator — the summary file is required
    for the wave completion check in Wave Execution Step 2
```

### Summary File Naming

Summary files follow the Plan File Convention from `workflow-common.md`:

```
.planning/phases/{NN-name}/{NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md
```

Examples:
- `.planning/phases/04-parallel-execution/04-01-SUMMARY.md`
- `.planning/phases/04-parallel-execution/04-02-SUMMARY.md`

The presence of a SUMMARY.md file is the signal used in Section 4, Step 2 to verify that a dependency plan completed. A failed plan still gets a SUMMARY.md (with Status: Failed) so that the dependency check correctly identifies and blocks dependent waves.

---

## Section 6: Error Scenarios

How to handle common failure modes without retrying or hiding problems.

```
1. AGENT SPAWN FAILURE
   Symptom: The Agent tool call itself returns an error (model unavailable,
            invalid parameters, context too large, team_name invalid, etc.)
   Action:
   - Mark the plan as failed in the wave results
   - Call TaskUpdate to mark the plan's task as failed (if task was created)
   - Capture the tool error message
   - Write a SUMMARY.md with Status: Failed and the spawn error details
   - Continue executing other plans in the same wave that haven't failed
   - After wave collection, apply post-wave decision logic (Section 4, Step 7)
   Example errors:
   - "Failed to spawn agent for plan 04-01: model sonnet unavailable"
   - "Failed to spawn agent for plan 04-01: team 'phase-04-execution' not found"

2. AGENT TIMEOUT / CONTEXT OVERFLOW
   Symptom: Agent runs but produces incomplete output; context limit reached
   Action:
   - Capture whatever output the agent produced before stopping
   - Treat as a failure — do not try to resume the agent
   - Write SUMMARY.md with Status: Failed and note: "Agent context limit reached.
     The plan may need to be split into smaller tasks."
   - Include partial output in Error Details for diagnosis

3. VERIFICATION FAILURE
   Symptom: Agent completes all tasks but verify commands produce unexpected results
            (file missing, grep finds wrong content, line count too low, etc.)
   Action:
   - Do NOT mark as hard failure — agent completed its work
   - Status: Complete with Warnings
   - Include the failing verify outputs in the Verification Results section
   - Note in Issues Encountered: "Verify step N returned unexpected result: {output}"
   - The plan is not retried; /legion:review will assess whether it's acceptable

4. FILE MODIFICATION CONFLICT (same-wave file collision)
   Symptom: Two plans in the same wave have overlapping files_modified entries
   Detection: During plan discovery (Section 2, Step 5d)
   Action:
   - Do NOT abort — continue execution with a warning
   - Log: "Warning: plans {NN}-{PP} and {NN}-{PP2} both modify {file path}.
     The second agent's changes will overwrite the first. Review the phase plan."
   - In the wave completion report, flag the conflict explicitly
   - Suggest the user re-plan the phase to move one plan to a later wave

5. MISSING PERSONALITY FILE
   Symptom: The agent .md file does not exist at {AGENTS_DIR}/{agent-id}.md
   Action:
   - Fall back to autonomous execution — run the plan without personality injection
   - Log: "Warning: personality file not found for {agent-id} at {expected-path}.
     Executing plan {NN}-{PP} as autonomous (no personality injection)."
   - In the plan SUMMARY.md, note the fallback under Issues Encountered
   - Do NOT fail the plan because of a missing personality file

6. NO PLANS FOUND
   Symptom: The phase directory exists but contains no {NN}-{PP}-PLAN.md files
   Action:
   - Error immediately — do not attempt execution
   - Message: "No plans found for Phase {N} in .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/.
     Run /legion:plan {N} first to generate plan files."
   - Suggest: check if the phase directory name matches STATE.md's current phase

7. PARTIAL WAVE FAILURE (some plans succeed, some fail)
   Symptom: A wave with multiple plans has a mix of successes and failures
   Action:
   - Write SUMMARY.md files for ALL plans in the wave (both succeeded and failed)
   - Collect and report all results before making the post-wave stop decision
   - Stop after the wave — do not proceed to the next wave even if most plans succeeded
   - Report clearly: "Wave {N}: {X} of {Y} plans succeeded. Stopping before Wave {N+1}.
     Failed plans: {list}."
   - This prevents later waves from building on a broken foundation

8. PHASE ALREADY PARTIALLY EXECUTED
   Symptom: Some SUMMARY.md files already exist for plans in the phase
   Detection: During plan discovery
   Action:
   - Report the already-completed plans: "Found {count} existing summaries.
     The following plans have already been executed: {list}"
   - Ask user: "Re-run all plans (including completed ones), or skip to
     incomplete plans only?"
   - If skip: filter the wave map to exclude plans with existing SUMMARY.md files
   - If re-run: delete existing SUMMARY.md files and execute all plans fresh

9. AGENT COMPLETES BUT DOESN'T SEND MESSAGE
   Symptom: An agent goes idle without sending a SendMessage to the coordinator.
            The agent may have completed its work but forgot the Reporting Results step.
   Detection: Agent shows as idle in the Team but no SendMessage was received
   Action:
   - Send a follow-up message to the agent via SendMessage:
     "Your task appears complete but no summary was received. Please send your
      structured summary now using SendMessage with Status, Files, Verification,
      Decisions, Issues, and Errors fields."
   - Wait for the agent's response
   - If the agent still doesn't respond: infer the result from the filesystem
     - Check if the plan's files_modified list has been created/updated
     - Run the plan's <verification> commands manually
     - Write the SUMMARY.md based on filesystem evidence
     - Mark Status as "Complete with Warnings" and note: "Agent did not send
       completion message — result inferred from filesystem."
```

This skill implements patterns defined in `workflow-common.md`:

| Pattern | Source Section | Used In |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Personality Injection Pattern | workflow-common.md — Personality Injection Pattern | Section 3 |
| Wave Execution Pattern | workflow-common.md — Wave Execution Pattern | Section 4 |
| Cost Profile Convention | workflow-common.md — Cost Profile Convention | Section 1 (Sonnet for execution) |
| Error Handling Pattern | workflow-common.md — Error Handling Pattern | Section 6 |

| State Update Pattern | workflow-common.md — State Update Pattern | Section 4, Step 8 |

Agent file paths are resolved using the `agent-registry.md` Agent Catalog (Section 1), which maps every agent ID to its file path.

### Quick Reference: Agent Path Format

```
{AGENTS_DIR}/{agent-id}.md

Examples:
  {AGENTS_DIR}/engineering-senior-developer.md
  {AGENTS_DIR}/testing-evidence-collector.md
  {AGENTS_DIR}/design-ux-architect.md
  {AGENTS_DIR}/agents-orchestrator.md

AGENTS_DIR is resolved once per command via workflow-common Agent Path Resolution Protocol.
```

If an agent-id is ambiguous, check agent-registry.md Section 1 for the canonical file path.
