# Polymath Engine

Execution engine for pre-flight alignment workflows. Consumed by `/legion:explore` and potentially other exploration contexts. Implements the research-first, structured-choice methodology defined in `agents/polymath.md`.

---

## Section 1: Research Phase (Silent)

**Purpose:** Gather context BEFORE interacting with the user.

**When to run:** Automatically at the start of every exploration session.

**Research checklist:**

1. **Codebase scan** — Does this build on existing code?
   ```bash
   # Search for relevant files based on user's concept keywords
   grep -r "keyword" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.md" . 2>/dev/null | head -20
   ```
   - Look for: existing implementations, similar features, reusable components
   - Document: what exists, what patterns are established

2. **Documentation scan** — What does Legion already know?
   - Read `.planning/PROJECT.md` if exists (existing project context)
   - Read `.planning/CODEBASE.md` if exists (brownfield mappings)
   - Read relevant skill files matching the domain (grep `triggers:` for keywords)
   - Check `.planning/memory/` for patterns from past projects

3. **External research** — Is this a known domain?
   - If domain-specific (e.g., "OAuth", "WebRTC", "Kubernetes"): use WebSearch or WebFetch
   - If library/framework mentioned: check for best practices
   - Document: standard approaches, common pitfalls

**Research output format:**
```markdown
## Research Findings

**Codebase:**
- Found: [files/patterns]
- Relevant to exploration: [how it relates]

**Documentation:**
- Existing project: [yes/no, summary if yes]
- Relevant skills: [list]
- Past patterns: [from memory if available]

**External:**
- Domain knowledge: [what we know about this space]
- Standard approaches: [common solutions]
- Potential pitfalls: [risks to flag]
```

**Critical rule:** Research must complete in under 2 minutes. If deeper research needed, flag as a gap to explore, don't block the conversation.

### Extended Thinking Mode

If `settings.json` `models.planning_reasoning` is `true` AND the active adapter's `supports_extended_thinking` is `true`:
- Use `adapter.model_planning` (e.g., `opus`) for the research synthesis and crystallization phases
- Extended thinking provides deeper analysis of:
  - Cross-source pattern recognition (connecting codebase findings with external research)
  - Gap detection accuracy (identifying implicit unknowns the user hasn't surfaced)
  - Crystallization quality (sharper summaries with better-justified recommendations)
- The exploration output format is identical; only the reasoning depth changes

If `models.planning_reasoning` is `false`: use `adapter.model_execution` as normal

---

## Section 2: Structured Choice Protocol

**Purpose:** Every user interaction is a selection, not composition.

**Choice format:**
```markdown
[Brief context — 1-2 sentences]

Which describes your situation?
→ [Option A]: [Clear description]
  [Option B]: [Clear description]
  [Option C]: [Clear description]
  [Option D]: Not sure / None of these
```

**Choice design principles:**

1. **Mutually exclusive** — Options shouldn't overlap
2. **Collectively exhaustive** — Include "Other/Not sure" for gaps
3. **Concrete** — Avoid vague options like "It depends"
4. **Actionable** — Each choice should lead to a clear next step
5. **Research-informed** — Reference findings: "Based on [research result], which applies?"

**Arrow keys + Enter implementation:**
- Use adapter.ask_user with choice list
- Each choice has explicit ID for tracking
- Capture selection in exploration state

**Anti-patterns to reject:**
- Open text fields
- "Tell me more" prompts
- Vague options like "Something else"
- Questions requiring user research (that's Polymath's job)

## Section 3: Knowledge Gap Detection

**Purpose:** Identify and categorize what's still unknown.

**Gap categories:**

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Technical | Stack/technology unknowns | "Which database?" |
| Scope | Feature boundary unclear | "MVP vs full feature?" |
| Constraint | Limitations undefined | "Timeline? Budget?" |
| Dependency | External requirements | "Need API access?" |
| Risk | Potential blockers | "Compliance requirements?" |

**Onboard gap categories:**

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Architecture | Structural patterns unclear | "How do modules communicate?" |
| Convention | Coding standards undefined | "What naming convention is used?" |
| Dependency | Package purposes unknown | "Why is this library included?" |
| Setup | Environment configuration unclear | "How to run this locally?" |
| History | Design decision rationale missing | "Why was this pattern chosen?" |

**Compare gap categories:**

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Criteria | Evaluation dimensions unclear | "What metrics matter most?" |
| Trade-off | Hidden costs or conflicts unknown | "What do you lose by choosing X?" |
| Validation | Claims unverified by evidence | "Is that benchmark accurate?" |
| Cost | Total cost of ownership unclear | "What are the long-term maintenance costs?" |
| Experience | Team/user familiarity unknown | "Has anyone used this in production?" |

**Debate gap categories:**

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Position | Framing of a side is unclear or incomplete | "What exactly does Position A claim?" |
| Evidence | Supporting data is missing or unverified | "Is there research backing this argument?" |
| Assumption | Unstated premises underlying an argument | "What assumption makes this argument work?" |
| Precedent | Historical examples or case studies missing | "Has this approach been tried before?" |
| Blind spot | Risks or consequences not yet considered | "What could go wrong that neither side addressed?" |

**Gap detection workflow:**

1. **Track stated vs implied**
   - User stated: captured in choices selected
   - User implied: inferred from context
   - What's missing: gaps = (what's needed) - (stated + implied)

2. **Surface gaps explicitly**
   ```markdown
   I've captured:
   - [what we know]
   
   Still unclear:
   - [Gap 1]: [category] — [specific question]
   
   Which describes [Gap 1]?
   → [Option A]
     [Option B]
     [Option C]
   ```

3. **Force resolution or acceptance**
   - Every gap must be either: answered, explicitly deferred, or flagged as blocker
   - No "we'll figure it out later" — that's a deferral decision

**Gap resolution patterns:**
- **Answered:** User selects specific option → documented
- **Deferred:** User selects "Decide later" → added to "Deferred Decisions" list
- **Blocker:** User selects "Don't know yet" → may trigger "Park" recommendation

## Section 4: Exchange Management

**Purpose:** Keep exploration bounded and purposeful.

**Exchange limit:** Maximum 7 exchanges (research doesn't count as exchange).

**Exchange tracking:**
```yaml
exchange: 3/7
topic: scope-prioritization
previous_choices:
  - exchange-1: greenfield-vs-brownfield → greenfield
  - exchange-2: domain-type → web-application
  - exchange-3: scope-level → [current]
```

**Exchange types:**

| Exchange # | Purpose | Typical Choices |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Orient | Greenfield/brownfield, domain type |
| 2-3 | Clarify | Scope level, key features, constraints |
| 4-5 | Gap fill | Technical stack, timeline, dependencies |
| 6 | Confirm | Verify understanding, surface any final gaps |
| 7 | Decide | Proceed / Explore more / Park |

**Onboard exchange pattern:**

| Exchange # | Purpose | Typical Choices |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Depth selection | Overview / Architecture / Code walkthrough |
| 2-3 | Area exploration | Directory focus, pattern investigation |
| 4-5 | Deep dive | Specific files, data flow, dependency chains |
| 6 | Knowledge check | Validate understanding of key concepts |
| 7 | Decide | Familiarized / Explore deeper / Switch area |

**Compare exchange pattern:**

| Exchange # | Purpose | Typical Choices |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Alternative identification | Confirm/add alternatives from research |
| 2 | Criteria definition | Select relevant comparison criteria |
| 3 | Criteria weighting | Weight each criterion: critical/important/nice-to-have |
| 4 | Structured comparison | Review scores, request deeper evidence |
| 5 | Trade-offs & constraints | Identify deal-breakers, hidden costs |
| 6 | Recommendation review | Accept/reject recommendation, challenge scores |
| 7 | Decision & capture | Commit to choice, capture rationale |

**Debate exchange pattern:**

| Exchange # | Purpose | Typical Choices |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | Position setup | Confirm/adjust opposing positions |
| 2 | Evidence for Position A | Assess strength: Compelling/Reasonable/Weak/Mixed |
| 3 | Evidence for Position B | Assess strength: Compelling/Reasonable/Weak/Mixed |
| 4 | Counter-arguments | Which side countered more effectively |
| 5 | Blind spots (optional) | Which position has more hidden risk |
| 6 | Scoring & winner | Review scores, accept or challenge |
| 7 | Decision & next steps | Winner clear / Need more evidence / Declare tie / Flip sides |

**DPO-inspired scoring mechanism:**

The debate mode uses a scoring system inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Instead of the LLM judging which side is "better," the system collects human preference signals at each exchange and tallies them into a score.

**Preference signals** — Binary per exchange. Each exchange produces a signal favoring one position or a tie.

**Assessment-to-signal mapping:**
- Evidence exchanges (Phases 2 & 3):
  - Compelling/Reasonable → that position preferred (+1)
  - Weak → opposing position preferred (+1)
  - Mixed → Tie (+0.5 each)
- Counter-argument exchange (Phase 4):
  - "Position X countered more effectively" → Position X preferred (+1)
  - Neither/Both weak → Tie (+0.5 each)
- Blind spots exchange (Phase 5, optional):
  - "Reveals more risk for Position X" → opposing position preferred (+1)
  - Equal → Tie (+0.5 each)

**Scoring** — Simple tally of preference signals per position.

**Win probability** — P(A) = score_A / (score_A + score_B)

**Confidence thresholds:**
- **High**: Winner has >70% win probability
- **Medium**: Winner has 50-70% win probability
- **Low**: Winner has <50% win probability (effective tie)

**Why DPO-inspired** — Uses human preference signals to determine the winner rather than relying on LLM judgment. The LLM presents balanced evidence; the human evaluates it. This prevents the LLM from biasing the outcome toward its own training preferences.

**Early exit conditions:**
- User explicitly requests exit (save progress option)
- Crystallization achieved early (offer early decision)
- Blocker discovered (recommend park)

**Usage:**
This skill is not invoked directly. The `/legion:explore` command instantiates this engine and the Polymath agent together.
