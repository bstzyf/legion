# Legion Workflow Common Core

Always-load core conventions for every `/legion:` command. This file is intentionally compact.

## Core Responsibilities
- Detect and load the active runtime adapter before command-specific logic.
- Resolve canonical state file paths under `.planning/`.
- Resolve `settings.json` defaults safely when file is missing or invalid.
- Resolve `AGENTS_DIR` once per invocation before loading personality files.
- Provide baseline command-to-skill mapping and context budget ceilings.

## Adapter Detection (Core)

1. Check `.legion-cli` override in project root.
2. If absent, evaluate adapter primary detections from `adapters/*.md`.
3. If no primary match, evaluate adapter secondary detections.
4. If still no match, default to Claude Code adapter.
5. Read the full adapter file and use adapter-defined tool mapping/model settings.

## User Interaction (Core)

**CRITICAL**: When commands or skills reference `adapter.ask_user`, `Use adapter.ask_user`, or instruct you to ask the user a question with structured choices, you MUST use the `AskUserQuestion` tool. Do NOT output questions as raw text and wait for a reply. The `AskUserQuestion` tool provides structured selection UI (arrow keys + Enter) which is the intended interaction model for all Legion commands.

For Claude Code, `adapter.ask_user` maps to:
```
AskUserQuestion(questions: [{
  question: "Your question here",
  options: [
    {label: "option-1", description: "Description of option 1"},
    {label: "option-2", description: "Description of option 2"}
  ]
}])
```

This applies to ALL question prompts in ALL commands — confirmation gates, mode selection, workflow preferences, and any other structured choice.

## State Paths (Core)

| File | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| PROJECT.md | `.planning/PROJECT.md` | Vision, requirements, constraints |
| ROADMAP.md | `.planning/ROADMAP.md` | Phase sequence and plan tracking |
| STATE.md | `.planning/STATE.md` | Current state and next action |
| REQUIREMENTS.md | `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` | Expanded requirement details |
| Phase plans | `.planning/phases/{NN-name}/` | PLAN/SUMMARY/CONTEXT files |

## Settings Resolution (Core)

Read `settings.json` from repo root if available. If missing/invalid, use defaults.

Defaults:
- `planning.max_tasks_per_plan = 3`
- `review.max_cycles = 3`
- `execution.agent_personality_verbosity = "full"`
- `integrations.github = "prompt"`
- `memory.enabled = true`
- `memory.project_scoped_only = true`
- `control_mode = "guarded"`

### Mode Profile Resolution

After resolving `control_mode` from settings (default: `"guarded"`), load the corresponding profile:

1. Read `.planning/config/control-modes.yaml`
2. Look up `profiles[control_mode]` to get the flag set
3. If file missing or mode not found: fall back to `guarded` profile hardcoded as:
   - `authority_enforcement: true`, `domain_filtering: true`, `human_approval_required: true`, `file_scope_restriction: false`, `read_only: false`
4. Pass resolved profile to authority-enforcer and wave-executor integration points

The resolved profile is a set of 5 boolean flags: `authority_enforcement`, `domain_filtering`, `human_approval_required`, `file_scope_restriction`, `read_only`.

## Agent Path Resolution (Core)

Resolve once per command invocation:
1. `~/.claude/agents/agents-orchestrator.md` (Claude global install)
2. `agents/agents-orchestrator.md` (local dev mode)
3. Manifest fallback: `~/.claude/legion/manifest.json` then `~/.legion/manifest.json`
4. If none found: fail fast with install guidance

Use resolved path for all personality reads:
`{AGENTS_DIR}/{agent-id}.md`

## Personality Injection (Core)

- **Retrieval-led reasoning**: ALWAYS read the agent personality file before spawning. Do NOT substitute pre-trained knowledge for the personality file contents. The Dynamic Knowledge Index in AGENTS.md provides the complete file map — use it to locate agent files by division, then Read the full file. This is non-negotiable.
- Load full personality markdown for assigned agent.
- Inject personality content + task instructions into adapter spawn prompt.
- Use `adapter.model_execution` for execution agents unless command overrides it.

## Command-to-Skill Mapping (Core)

| Command | Always Loads | Conditionally Loads |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `/legion:start` | workflow-common-core, questioning-flow, agent-registry, portfolio-manager, codebase-mapper | workflow-common-domains |
| `/legion:plan` | workflow-common-core, agent-registry, phase-decomposer | memory-manager, github-sync, codebase-mapper, plan-critique, spec-pipeline, workflow-common-memory, workflow-common-github, workflow-common-domains |
| `/legion:build` | workflow-common-core, agent-registry, wave-executor, execution-tracker | memory-manager, github-sync, codebase-mapper, workflow-common-memory, workflow-common-github |
| `/legion:review` | workflow-common-core, agent-registry, review-loop, review-panel, execution-tracker | memory-manager, github-sync, design-workflows, workflow-common-memory, workflow-common-github, workflow-common-domains |
| `/legion:status` | workflow-common-core, execution-tracker, milestone-tracker | memory-manager, github-sync, codebase-mapper, workflow-common-memory, workflow-common-github |
| `/legion:quick` | workflow-common-core, agent-registry | workflow-common-domains |
| `/legion:portfolio` | workflow-common-core, portfolio-manager | workflow-common-github |
| `/legion:milestone` | workflow-common-core, milestone-tracker, execution-tracker | github-sync, workflow-common-github |
| `/legion:agent` | workflow-common-core, agent-registry, agent-creator | workflow-common-domains |
| `/legion:advise` | workflow-common-core, agent-registry | workflow-common-domains |
| `/legion:board`     | workflow-common-core, agent-registry, board-of-directors, cli-dispatch | workflow-common-memory, workflow-common-github |
| `/legion:retro` | workflow-common-core, memory-manager, execution-tracker | workflow-common-memory |
| `/legion:ship` | workflow-common-core, ship-pipeline, execution-tracker | github-sync, workflow-common-github |
| `/legion:learn` | workflow-common-core, memory-manager | workflow-common-memory |
| `/legion:update` | workflow-common-core | workflow-common-github |
| `/legion:validate` | workflow-common-core, agent-registry | (none) |

## Context Budget Ceiling (Core)

Execution-context budgets (always-load skills only):
- `build`: soft 180 KB, hard 225 KB
- `plan`: soft 180 KB, hard 225 KB
- `review`: soft 180 KB, hard 225 KB
- `status`: soft 120 KB, hard 150 KB

Release checks enforce hard ceilings and print telemetry for every command. Agent line-count remains telemetry, not a gate.

## State File Quick Validation

Lightweight validation that runs at the start of every command that loads project context. Fast enough to not add noticeable latency (pattern matching only, no full parse).

### Trigger
Runs automatically after loading PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, and STATE.md in the standard context loading step. Only runs for commands that load these files (i.e., commands with `@.planning/PROJECT.md`, `@.planning/ROADMAP.md`, or `@.planning/STATE.md` in their `<context>` block). Commands that do not load project state (e.g., `/legion:update`) skip this entirely.

### Checks

1. **PROJECT.md format check**
   - Verify file starts with `# ` (has a title)
   - Verify file contains `## Requirements` or `## Goals` section header
   - If missing: warn "PROJECT.md may be malformed — missing title or requirements section"

2. **ROADMAP.md format check**
   - Verify file contains a markdown table with at least one `|` row
   - Verify table has "Phase" and "Status" columns (case-insensitive header match)
   - If missing: warn "ROADMAP.md may be malformed — missing phase table"

3. **STATE.md format check**
   - Verify file contains "Current" (case-insensitive) somewhere in first 10 lines
   - If missing: warn "STATE.md may be malformed — missing current position section"

### Behavior on Failure
- Warnings are displayed once per session
- Warnings do NOT block command execution (graceful degradation)
- For full validation: direct user to `/legion:validate`
- Message format: "State file warning: {message}. Run `/legion:validate` for full diagnostics."
- If a state file does not exist at all, skip its check silently (file-not-found is handled by the command's own project existence check, not by quick validation)
