# Memory Manager

Cross-session memory layer for Legion. Tracks agent performance and task outcomes, provides pattern recall with recency-based decay, and degrades gracefully when memory is not present. All memory operations are explicit calls from workflows — no hooks, no background processes.

- Memory Conventions from `workflow-common.md` (lifecycle, paths, integration points)

## Section 1: Memory Principles

Core rules governing all memory operations:

1. **Passive and opt-in** — memory operations are called explicitly by workflows. No hooks, no background processes, no automatic triggers. A workflow must choose to store or recall.
2. **Human-readable markdown** — all memory is stored as structured markdown tables, consistent with PROJECT.md, STATE.md, and all other Legion state files. No JSON, no binary, no databases.
3. **Graceful degradation** — every caller checks for memory availability before using it. If memory files don't exist, the workflow proceeds identically to how it worked before Phase 9. Memory is an enhancement, never a requirement.
4. **Append-only records** — outcome records are added, never modified or deleted automatically. Decay happens at recall time through scoring, not through deletion.
5. **Supplement, not override** — memory boosts agent recommendations but cannot override mandatory roles, division alignment, or the core recommendation algorithm in agent-registry.md.
6. **Minimal footprint** — one directory (`.planning/memory/`), three files (`OUTCOMES.md`, `PATTERNS.md`, `ERRORS.md`). Each file has a distinct schema and purpose — no duplication across files.

---

## Section 2: Memory File Format

Memory lives in a single file:

```
Path: .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md
Created: on first store operation (not during project initialization)
```

**File structure**:

```markdown
# Memory — Outcome Log

Records agent performance and task outcomes for cross-session learning.
Managed by memory-manager skill. Do not edit manually unless pruning old records.

## Records

| ID | Date | Phase | Plan | Agent | Task Type | Outcome | Importance | Tags | Summary |
|----|------|-------|------|-------|-----------|---------|------------|------|---------|
| O-001 | 2026-03-01 | 5 | 05-01 | testing-reality-checker | quality-review | success | 3 | review, testing, workflow | Review-loop skill approved in 2 cycles |
| O-002 | 2026-03-01 | 5 | 05-02 | autonomous | workflow | success | 2 | review, command, status | /legion:review command implemented |
```

**Field definitions**:

| Field | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ID | `O-{NNN}` | Sequential, zero-padded to 3 digits. Next ID = count of existing records + 1 |
| Date | `YYYY-MM-DD` | When the outcome was recorded |
| Phase | Integer | Phase number where the outcome occurred |
| Plan | `NN-PP` | Plan ID (e.g., `05-01`) |
| Agent | Agent ID or `autonomous` | The agent that executed the work |
| Task Type | Tag from agent-registry | Primary task type category (e.g., `workflow`, `frontend`, `quality-review`) |
| Outcome | `success` / `partial` / `failed` | How the plan or review resolved |
| Importance | `1` through `5` | Significance score (see Importance Scoring below) |
| Tags | Comma-separated | Searchable keywords: phase slug, agent division, technology, domain |
| Summary | Free text (one line) | Brief description of what happened |

**Importance scoring**:

| Base Score | Condition |
|------------|-----------|
| 5 | Plan failed — critical learning signal |
| 4 | Review escalated (3 cycles exhausted) |
| 3 | Plan partial or review needed 2+ cycles |
| 2 | Standard success — plan completed, review passed |
| 1 | Trivial or expected outcome (autonomous config changes) |

**Adjustment modifiers** (add to base, cap at 5):
- First time an agent handles this task type: +1
- Cross-division work (agent from different division than task type): +1
- Review found 3+ blockers before passing: +1

---

## Section 3: Store Operation

How to add outcome records. Called by build.md (after plan execution) and review.md (after review cycle completes).

```
Store Outcome:

Step 1: Check memory directory
  - If .planning/memory/ does not exist: create it with mkdir -p
  - If .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md does not exist: create it with the header template from Section 2

Step 2: Determine next ID
  - Read OUTCOMES.md
  - Count rows in the Records table (exclude header row)
  - Next ID = O-{count + 1}, zero-padded to 3 digits

Step 3: Calculate importance
  - Start with base score from the Importance Scoring table in Section 2
  - Apply adjustment modifiers
  - Cap at 5

Step 4: Build the record
  - Date: current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Phase: from the current phase context
  - Plan: from the plan ID being tracked
  - Agent: agent ID that executed the plan, or "autonomous"
  - Task Type: inferred from the plan's tasks (match against agent-registry task type tags)
  - Outcome: success / partial / failed (from plan execution result)
  - Importance: calculated in Step 3
  - Tags: phase slug, agent division, task-related keywords
  - Summary: one-line description of the outcome

Step 5: Append the record
  - Read current OUTCOMES.md
  - Append the new row to the Records table
  - Write updated OUTCOMES.md

Step 6: Verify
  - Confirm the new record appears in OUTCOMES.md
  - If write failed: output the record as text to the user (never lose data)
```

**Store Decision (embedded in outcome records)**:

Key decisions are captured in the Summary and Tags fields of outcome records rather than a separate file. For example:
- "Chose engineering-senior-developer over engineering-rapid-prototyper for production Laravel work" (tags: `agent-selection, engineering`)
- "Escalated review after 3 cycles — milestone-tracker had persistent edge case" (tags: `escalation, review, milestone`)

This keeps the memory layer minimal (one file) while still enabling decision recall for session briefing.

---

## Section 4: Recall Operation

How to query memory. Called by phase-decomposer.md (agent recommendation) and status.md (session briefing).

**General Recall**:

```
Recall Outcomes:

Input:
  - query_tags: list of tags to filter by (optional, matches any)
  - agent_id: specific agent to filter by (optional)
  - task_type: specific task type to filter by (optional)
  - limit: max records to return (default: 20)

Step 1: Check memory exists
  - If .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md does not exist: return empty results
  - Do NOT create the file on recall — only store creates it

Step 2: Read and parse OUTCOMES.md
  - Parse the Records table into individual records
  - If parse fails (malformed table): log warning, return empty results

Step 3: Filter
  - If query_tags provided: keep records where any tag matches any query_tag
  - If agent_id provided: keep records where Agent matches agent_id
  - If task_type provided: keep records where Task Type matches task_type
  - Multiple filters are AND-combined

Step 4: Apply decay scoring
  - For each record, calculate:
    days_old = (current_date - record_date) in days
    recency_weight:
      - days_old <= 7:  1.0
      - days_old <= 30: 0.7
      - days_old <= 90: 0.4
      - days_old > 90:  0.1
    decay_score = importance × recency_weight

Step 5: Exclude low-signal records
  - Remove records where decay_score < 0.2

Step 6: Sort and limit
  - Sort by decay_score descending
  - Return top {limit} records

Step 7: Pruning suggestion (informational only)
  - If total record count exceeds 200:
    Output note: "Memory has {count} records. Consider pruning old entries with
    `/legion:quick prune memory records older than 90 days`."
  - Never auto-prune. User decides.
```

**Recall for Agent Recommendation**:

A specialized recall mode used by phase-decomposer.md Section 4 during agent selection.

```
Recall Agent Scores:

Input:
  - task_types: list of task type tags from the current plan analysis

Step 1: Check memory exists
  - If .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md does not exist: return empty map

Step 2: Recall all outcomes matching task_types
  - Use general recall with query_tags = task_types

Step 3: Group by agent_id
  - For each unique agent in the filtered results:
    - total_tasks = count of records for this agent
    - successes = count where outcome = "success"
    - failures = count where outcome = "failed"
    - success_rate = successes / total_tasks
    - avg_importance = mean of importance values
    - avg_recency_weight = mean of recency_weight values

Step 4: Calculate memory score per agent
  - memory_score = (success_rate × 3.0) + (avg_importance × 0.5)
  - Apply recency: memory_score = memory_score × avg_recency_weight
  - Clamp to range [0, 5]

Step 5: Return agent_id → memory_score mapping
  - Only include agents with total_tasks >= 2 (avoid one-off noise)
  - Sort by memory_score descending
```

**Recall for Session Briefing**:

A specialized recall mode used by status.md for enriching the dashboard.

```
Recall Session Briefing:

Step 1: Check memory exists
  - If .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md does not exist: return empty briefing

Step 2: Recall recent outcomes
  - Use general recall with limit = 5, no filters
  - These are the most recent, highest-signal outcomes

Step 3: Calculate agent performance summary
  - Use the full (unfiltered) outcome set
  - Group by agent_id
  - For each agent: total tasks, success rate, average importance
  - Sort by total tasks descending
  - Return top 3 agents

Step 4: Return briefing data
  - recent_outcomes: list of 5 recent records
  - top_agents: list of 3 agent performance summaries
  - total_records: count of all records
```

---

## Section 5: Decay Rules

Decay is the mechanism that ensures recent outcomes matter more than old ones. It is computed at recall time, never applied destructively.

```
Recency Weight Formula:
  days_old = (current_date - record_date) in days

  if days_old <= 7:   recency_weight = 1.0   (full signal)
  if days_old <= 30:  recency_weight = 0.7   (recent)
  if days_old <= 90:  recency_weight = 0.4   (relevant)
  if days_old > 90:   recency_weight = 0.1   (historical)

Decay Score:
  decay_score = importance × recency_weight

  Example: importance=4, 15 days old → 4 × 0.7 = 2.8
  Example: importance=2, 60 days old → 2 × 0.4 = 0.8
  Example: importance=5, 120 days old → 5 × 0.1 = 0.5

Exclusion Threshold:
  Records with decay_score < 0.2 are excluded from recall results.
  This only affects importance=1 records older than 90 days (1 × 0.1 = 0.1 < 0.2).
  All other combinations remain above threshold.

No Auto-Deletion:
  Records are NEVER deleted by decay. They remain in OUTCOMES.md permanently.
  Decay only affects which records appear in recall results.
  Manual pruning is the user's choice, never automatic.
```

---

## Section 6: Graceful Degradation

The golden rule: every workflow that calls memory must work identically without it.

```
Caller Pattern (MUST be followed by all workflows that integrate memory):

  1. Check if .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md exists
  2. If exists:
     a. Call the appropriate recall or store operation
     b. Use the results to enhance the current operation
     c. If the memory operation fails: log a one-line warning, continue without memory
  3. If not exists:
     a. Skip the memory step entirely
     b. Do NOT create the file (only store operations create it)
     c. Do NOT display a warning or placeholder about missing memory
     d. Do NOT suggest the user set up memory
  4. NEVER:
     a. Error if memory files are missing
     b. Block workflow execution on memory operations
     c. Require memory for any workflow to function
     d. Change workflow behavior in a way that breaks without memory
     e. Add mandatory memory steps to any workflow's critical path
```

**Testing graceful degradation**:

To verify a workflow degrades gracefully:
1. Delete `.planning/memory/` entirely
2. Run the workflow (build, review, plan, status)
3. Confirm it completes successfully with no errors or warnings about memory
4. Re-run with memory present
5. Confirm memory data enhances but does not alter the core workflow result

---

## Section 7: Error Handling

- **Missing memory directory**: Store creates `.planning/memory/` on first write. Recall returns empty results. Neither operation errors.
- **Missing OUTCOMES.md**: Store creates it with the header template. Recall returns empty results.
- **Malformed OUTCOMES.md**: If the table cannot be parsed (missing columns, corrupted rows), log a one-line warning: "Warning: OUTCOMES.md could not be parsed. Proceeding without memory." Return empty results. Do NOT attempt to repair — the user should inspect manually.
- **Write failure during store**: Output the intended record as text to the user. Include all fields so the user can manually add it. Continue the workflow — memory loss is not a blocking error.
- **Excessive records (200+)**: On recall, output an informational note suggesting pruning. Never auto-prune. The note appears once per recall, not per record.
- **Concurrent writes**: Not a concern in Legion workflows — only one build/review runs at a time per project. If somehow two writes conflict, the second write wins (last-write-wins, consistent with all other Legion state files).
- **Date parsing failure**: If a record's date cannot be parsed, treat its recency_weight as 0.4 (middle of the range). Do not exclude records with unparseable dates.

## Section 8: Patterns Knowledge Base

Captures distilled wisdom from successful outcomes — what worked, under what conditions, and when to reuse it.

File path: `.planning/memory/PATTERNS.md`
Created: on first pattern store operation (not during project initialization)

**File structure:**

```markdown
# Memory — Pattern Library

Successful patterns distilled from agent outcomes. Each pattern captures what worked, under what conditions, and when to reuse it.
Managed by memory-manager skill. Do not edit manually unless curating entries.

## Patterns

| ID | Date | Pattern | Context | Reuse Criteria | Source | Tags |
|----|------|---------|---------|----------------|--------|------|
| P-001 | 2026-03-01 | Wave-parallel testing with dedicated QA agent | Phase 5 review — QA agent found 3 issues that parallel execution missed | Use when phase has 3+ plans in a wave AND includes test-adjacent tasks | O-001 | testing, wave-execution, quality |
```

**Field definitions:**

| Field | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ID | `P-{NNN}` | Sequential, zero-padded to 3 digits |
| Date | `YYYY-MM-DD` | When the pattern was captured |
| Pattern | Free text | Brief description of the successful approach (what was done) |
| Context | Free text | The situation where this pattern proved effective (when/why it worked) |
| Reuse Criteria | Free text | Conditions under which this pattern should be applied again |
| Source | `O-{NNN}` or free text | Link to the outcome record that generated this pattern, or description |
| Tags | Comma-separated | Searchable keywords: task types, agent divisions, technologies |

**Store Pattern operation:**

```
Store Pattern:

Step 1: Check memory directory
  - If .planning/memory/ does not exist: create it with mkdir -p
  - If .planning/memory/PATTERNS.md does not exist: create it with the header template above

Step 2: Determine next ID
  - Read PATTERNS.md
  - Count rows in the Patterns table (exclude header row)
  - Next ID = P-{count + 1}, zero-padded to 3 digits

Step 3: Build the record
  - Date: current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Pattern: describe what the agent did that worked well
  - Context: describe the situation (phase, task type, constraints)
  - Reuse Criteria: under what conditions should future agents try this approach
  - Source: link to the OUTCOMES.md record ID, or describe the source
  - Tags: task-related keywords for recall matching

Step 4: Append and verify
  - Append the new row to the Patterns table
  - Write updated PATTERNS.md
  - If write fails: output the record as text (never lose data)
```

**When to store patterns:**
- After `/legion:review` passes on first cycle (the approach worked cleanly)
- After an agent resolves a complex task with a novel approach (importance ≥ 4 in OUTCOMES.md)
- After a cross-division agent succeeds (unusual pairing worth remembering)
- NOT after every success — only when the approach has learning value

**Recall Patterns operation:**

```
Recall Patterns:

Input:
  - query_tags: list of tags to filter by (optional)
  - limit: max records to return (default: 10)

Step 1: Check if .planning/memory/PATTERNS.md exists
  - If not: return empty results (do NOT create the file)

Step 2: Read and parse PATTERNS.md
  - Parse the Patterns table into individual records
  - If parse fails: log warning, return empty results

Step 3: Filter by query_tags
  - If provided: keep records where any tag matches any query_tag
  - If not provided: return all records

Step 4: Apply recency scoring
  - Same decay formula as OUTCOMES.md (Section 5):
    days_old <= 7: 1.0, <= 30: 0.7, <= 90: 0.4, > 90: 0.1
  - No importance weight (all patterns are inherently high-value)
  - Sort by recency_weight descending

Step 5: Return top {limit} records
```

## Section 9: Error Knowledge Base

Maps error signatures to known fixes — so agents encountering the same error can immediately try the solution that worked before.

File path: `.planning/memory/ERRORS.md`
Created: on first error store operation

**File structure:**

```markdown
# Memory — Error Fixes

Error signatures mapped to known fixes. When an agent encounters a matching error, it should try the documented fix before investigating from scratch.
Managed by memory-manager skill. Do not edit manually unless curating entries.

## Errors

| ID | Date | Error Signature | Fix | Agent | Resolved | Tags |
|----|------|-----------------|-----|-------|----------|------|
| E-001 | 2026-03-01 | `TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined` in component render | Check for null/undefined data before mapping — add optional chaining or default empty array | engineering-senior-developer | true | frontend, react, null-safety |
```

**Field definitions:**

| Field | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ID | `E-{NNN}` | Sequential, zero-padded to 3 digits |
| Date | `YYYY-MM-DD` | When the error was first encountered |
| Error Signature | Free text | The error message or pattern (enough to match, not full stack trace) |
| Fix | Free text | What resolved the error (actionable, specific) |
| Agent | Agent ID | The agent that resolved it |
| Resolved | `true` / `false` | Whether the fix actually worked (false = attempted but unverified) |
| Tags | Comma-separated | Searchable keywords: technology, error category, file types |

**Store Error operation:**

```
Store Error:

Step 1: Check memory directory and file
  - If .planning/memory/ does not exist: create it with mkdir -p
  - If .planning/memory/ERRORS.md does not exist: create it with the header template above

Step 2: Check for duplicate
  - Read existing ERRORS.md
  - If an entry with a substantially similar Error Signature already exists:
    - If the existing fix worked (Resolved = true): skip store, return existing entry ID
    - If the existing fix did not work (Resolved = false): update with the new fix, set Resolved = true
  - Duplicate detection is fuzzy — match on key error terms, not exact string

Step 3: Determine next ID (using E-{NNN}, same zero-padding as PATTERNS.md)
  - Count rows in the Errors table (exclude header row)
  - Next ID = E-{count + 1}, zero-padded to 3 digits

Step 4: Build the record
  - Date: current date
  - Error Signature: the error message or pattern, trimmed to essential identifying info
  - Fix: what resolved the error (specific actions, not generic advice)
  - Agent: the agent that resolved it
  - Resolved: true if verified, false if attempted but not confirmed
  - Tags: technology, error category, affected file types

Step 5: Append and verify
  - Append the new row to the Errors table
  - Write updated ERRORS.md
  - If write fails: output the record as text (never lose data)
```

**When to store errors:**
- After an agent encounters and resolves an error during `/legion:build`
- After `/legion:review` identifies and fixes a recurring issue
- NOT for trivial errors (typos, missing imports) — only for errors that required investigation
- Error importance threshold: only store if the error took more than a trivial fix to resolve

**Recall Errors operation:**

```
Recall Errors:

Input:
  - error_text: the error message to match against (optional)
  - query_tags: list of tags to filter by (optional)
  - limit: max records to return (default: 5)

Step 1: Check if .planning/memory/ERRORS.md exists
  - If not: return empty results

Step 2: Read and parse ERRORS.md

Step 3: Match against error_text
  - If error_text provided: score each entry by keyword overlap between error_text and Error Signature
  - Rank by match score (higher = more keywords in common)
  - If query_tags also provided: AND-combine with tag filtering

Step 4: Filter by Resolved
  - Prioritize entries where Resolved = true (verified fixes)
  - Include Resolved = false entries at lower rank

Step 5: Return top {limit} records with Fix text prominently displayed
```

## Section 10: Cross-File Integration

How the three memory files work together as a unified knowledge layer.

```
Memory File Relationships:

OUTCOMES.md — Event log (raw data)
  Records individual task/review outcomes with agent, result, importance, date.
  Growing: appends every build/review cycle.
  Query pattern: "How did agent X perform on task type Y?"

PATTERNS.md — Distilled wisdom (curated knowledge)
  Captures what worked and when to reuse it, distilled from successful outcomes.
  Slower growing: only stored when an approach has genuine learning value.
  Query pattern: "What approaches have worked for task type Y?"

ERRORS.md — Fix database (troubleshooting reference)
  Maps error signatures to known fixes for faster resolution.
  Growing: appends when non-trivial errors are resolved.
  Query pattern: "Has this error been seen before? What fixed it?"

Data flow:
  Build outcome (success) → OUTCOMES.md → distill → PATTERNS.md
  Build outcome (failure + fix) → OUTCOMES.md + ERRORS.md
  Review outcome (pass on first cycle) → OUTCOMES.md → distill → PATTERNS.md
  Review outcome (found recurring issue) → OUTCOMES.md + ERRORS.md

All three files:
  - Live in .planning/memory/
  - Created on first write (not during initialization)
  - Follow identical graceful degradation (Section 6)
  - Use append-only records with sequential IDs
  - Never auto-prune or auto-delete
  - Are human-readable markdown tables
```

**Graceful degradation for all three files:**

The caller pattern from Section 6 applies identically to PATTERNS.md and ERRORS.md:
- Check for file existence before any read operation
- Return empty results (not errors) when file is absent
- Only store operations create the file
- Never block workflow execution on memory availability
- Never warn the user when memory files are absent

---

## Section 11: Branch-Aware Memory

Memory files live inside the git repository at `.planning/memory/`. This means they naturally branch and merge with `git checkout` and `git merge`. This section documents how agents should be branch-aware when storing and recalling memory.

**Branch Detection:**
```
Get Current Branch:
  Run: git branch --show-current
  Result: branch name (e.g., "main", "feature/auth", "phase-33-execution")
  Fallback: if command fails or returns empty, use "unknown"
```

**Branch Field in Records:**

Add a `Branch` column to all three memory file schemas. For each store operation (OUTCOMES, PATTERNS, ERRORS), record the current git branch.

Update the OUTCOMES.md table schema (Section 2) by adding a Branch column after Date:
```
| ID | Date | Branch | Phase | Plan | Agent | Task Type | Outcome | Importance | Tags | Summary |
```

Update the PATTERNS.md table schema (Section 8) by adding a Branch column after Date:
```
| ID | Date | Branch | Pattern | Context | Reuse Criteria | Source | Tags |
```

Update the ERRORS.md table schema (Section 9) by adding a Branch column after Date:
```
| ID | Date | Branch | Error Signature | Fix | Agent | Resolved | Tags |
```

**Branch-Scoped Recall:**
```
Branch-Scoped Recall (applies to all three recall operations):

Input (additional parameter):
  - branch_filter: specific branch name, "current", or "all" (default: "all")

Behavior:
  - "all": return records from all branches (default, backwards-compatible)
  - "current": detect current branch via git, filter to matching Branch field
  - specific name: filter to records where Branch matches the given name

Why branch-scoped recall matters:
  - Feature branches may have experimental patterns that don't apply to main
  - Error fixes on a branch may not be relevant after the branch merges
  - When recalling during /legion:plan on a feature branch, branch-specific
    context is more relevant than global context

Merge behavior:
  - When branches merge, git merges the memory files naturally
  - Append-only tables merge cleanly (no field-level conflicts)
  - If a merge conflict occurs: keep both records (resolve by accepting both sides)
  - After merge: records from both branches coexist, with their original Branch values preserved
```

**Backwards Compatibility:**
- Existing records without a Branch field are treated as "main" (or whatever the default branch is)
- All recall operations work identically when branch_filter is "all" (the default)
- No migration needed — old records are valid, new records just have an extra column
