# Memory Manager

Cross-session memory layer for Legion. Tracks agent performance and task outcomes, provides pattern recall with recency-based decay, and degrades gracefully when memory is not present. All memory operations are explicit calls from workflows — no hooks, no background processes.

- State File Locations from `workflow-common.md` (memory paths at `.planning/memory/`)
- Memory Conventions from `workflow-common.md` (lifecycle, paths, integration points)
- Execution Tracker Section 2 from `execution-tracker.md` (plan completion flow where memory recording is triggered)
- `.planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md` — the single memory file read and written by this skill

## Section 1: Memory Principles

Core rules governing all memory operations:

1. **Passive and opt-in** — memory operations are called explicitly by workflows. No hooks, no background processes, no automatic triggers. A workflow must choose to store or recall.
2. **Human-readable markdown** — all memory is stored as structured markdown tables, consistent with PROJECT.md, STATE.md, and all other Legion state files. No JSON, no binary, no databases.
3. **Graceful degradation** — every caller checks for memory availability before using it. If memory files don't exist, the workflow proceeds identically to how it worked before Phase 9. Memory is an enhancement, never a requirement.
4. **Append-only records** — outcome records are added, never modified or deleted automatically. Decay happens at recall time through scoring, not through deletion.
5. **Supplement, not override** — memory boosts agent recommendations but cannot override mandatory roles, division alignment, or the core recommendation algorithm in agent-registry.md.
6. **Minimal footprint** — one directory (`.planning/memory/`), four files (`OUTCOMES.md`, `PATTERNS.md`, `ERRORS.md`, `PREFERENCES.md`). Each file has a distinct schema and purpose — no duplication across files.
7. **Strict project scope** — memory recall and scoring are project-local by default. Agent outcomes from one project MUST NOT be used to boost or penalize recommendations in another project unless an explicit future opt-in feature is added.

## Section 2: Memory File Format

Memory lives in a single file:

```
Path: .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md
Created: on first store operation (not during project initialization)
```

**File structure**:

```markdown
# Memory — Outcome Log

Records agent performance and task outcomes for cross-session learning.
Managed by memory-manager skill. Do not edit manually unless pruning old records.

## Records

| ID | Date | Branch | Phase | Plan | Agent | Task Type | Outcome | Importance | Tags | Summary |
|----|------|--------|-------|------|-------|-----------|---------|------------|------|---------|
| O-001 | 2026-03-01 | main | 5 | 05-01 | testing-reality-checker | quality-review | success | 3 | review, testing, workflow | Review-loop skill approved in 2 cycles |
| O-002 | 2026-03-01 | main | 5 | 05-02 | autonomous | workflow | success | 2 | review, command, status | /legion:review command implemented |
```

**Field definitions**:

| Field | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ID | `O-{NNN}` | Sequential, zero-padded to 3 digits. Next ID = count of existing records + 1 |
| Date | `YYYY-MM-DD` | When the outcome was recorded |
| Branch | Git branch name | Current branch at record time (via `git branch --show-current`). Existing records without Branch are treated as default branch |
| Phase | Integer | Phase number where the outcome occurred |
| Plan | `NN-PP` | Plan ID (e.g., `05-01`) |
| Agent | Agent ID or `autonomous` | The agent that executed the work |
| Task Type | Tag from agent-registry | Primary task type category (e.g., `workflow`, `frontend`, `quality-review`) |
| Outcome | `success` / `partial` / `failed` | How the plan or review resolved |
| Importance | `1` through `5` | Significance score (see Importance Scoring below) |
| Tags | Comma-separated | Searchable keywords: phase slug, agent division, technology, domain |
| Summary | Free text (one line) | Brief description of what happened |

**Importance scoring**:

| Base Score | Condition |
|------------|-----------|
| 5 | Plan failed — critical learning signal |
| 4 | Review escalated (3 cycles exhausted) |
| 3 | Plan partial or review needed 2+ cycles |
| 2 | Standard success — plan completed, review passed |
| 1 | Trivial or expected outcome (autonomous config changes) |

**Adjustment modifiers** (add to base, cap at 5):
- First time an agent handles this task type: +1
- Cross-division work (agent from different division than task type): +1
- Review found 3+ blockers before passing: +1

---

## Section 3: Store Operation

How to add outcome records. Called by build.md (after plan execution) and review.md (after review cycle completes).

```
Store Outcome:

Step 1: Check memory directory
  - If .planning/memory/ does not exist: create it with mkdir -p
  - If .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md does not exist: create it with the header template from Section 2

Step 2: Determine next ID
  - Read OUTCOMES.md
  - Count rows in the Records table (exclude header row)
  - Next ID = O-{count + 1}, zero-padded to 3 digits

Step 3: Calculate importance
  - Start with base score from the Importance Scoring table in Section 2
  - Apply adjustment modifiers
  - Cap at 5

Step 4: Build the record
  - Date: current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Phase: from the current phase context
  - Plan: from the plan ID being tracked
  - Agent: agent ID that executed the plan, or "autonomous"
  - Task Type: inferred from the plan's tasks (match against agent-registry task type tags)
  - Outcome: success / partial / failed (from plan execution result)
  - Importance: calculated in Step 3
  - Tags: phase slug, agent division, task-related keywords
  - Summary: one-line description of the outcome

Step 5: Append the record
  - Read current OUTCOMES.md
  - Append the new row to the Records table
  - Write updated OUTCOMES.md

Step 6: Verify
  - Confirm the new record appears in OUTCOMES.md
  - If write failed: output the record as text to the user (never lose data)
```

**Store Decision (embedded in outcome records)**:

Key decisions are captured in the Summary and Tags fields of outcome records rather than a separate file. For example:
- "Chose engineering-senior-developer over engineering-rapid-prototyper for production Laravel work" (tags: `agent-selection, engineering`)
- "Escalated review after 3 cycles — milestone-tracker had persistent edge case" (tags: `escalation, review, milestone`)

This keeps the memory layer minimal (one file) while still enabling decision recall for session briefing.

---

## Section 4: Recall Operation

How to query memory. Called by phase-decomposer.md (agent recommendation) and status.md (session briefing).

**General Recall**:

```
Recall Outcomes:

Input:
  - query_tags: list of tags to filter by (optional, matches any)
  - agent_id: specific agent to filter by (optional)
  - task_type: specific task type to filter by (optional)
  - limit: max records to return (default: 20)

Step 1: Check memory exists
  - If .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md does not exist: return empty results
  - Do NOT create the file on recall — only store creates it

Step 2: Read and parse OUTCOMES.md
  - Parse the Records table into individual records
  - If parse fails (malformed table): log warning, return empty results

Step 3: Filter
  - If query_tags provided: keep records where any tag matches any query_tag
  - If agent_id provided: keep records where Agent matches agent_id
  - If task_type provided: keep records where Task Type matches task_type
  - Multiple filters are AND-combined

Step 4: Apply decay scoring
  - For each record, calculate:
    days_old = (current_date - record_date) in days
    recency_weight:
      - days_old <= 7:  1.0
      - days_old <= 30: 0.7
      - days_old <= 90: 0.4
      - days_old > 90:  0.1
    decay_score = importance × recency_weight

Step 5: Exclude low-signal records
  - Remove records where decay_score < 0.2

Step 6: Sort and limit
  - Sort by decay_score descending
  - Return top {limit} records

Step 7: Pruning suggestion (informational only)
  - If total record count exceeds 200:
    Output note: "Memory has {count} records. Consider pruning old entries with
    `/legion:quick prune memory records older than 90 days`."
  - Never auto-prune. User decides.
```

**Recall for Agent Recommendation**:

A specialized recall mode used by phase-decomposer.md Section 4 during agent selection.

```
Recall Agent Scores:

Input:
  - task_types: list of task type tags from the current plan analysis

Step 1: Check memory exists
  - If .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md does not exist: return empty map

Step 2: Recall all outcomes matching task_types
  - Use general recall with query_tags = task_types

Step 3: Group by agent_id
  - For each unique agent in the filtered results:
    - total_tasks = count of records for this agent
    - successes = count where outcome = "success"
    - failures = count where outcome = "failed"
    - success_rate = successes / total_tasks
    - avg_importance = mean of importance values
    - avg_recency_weight = mean of recency_weight values

Step 4: Calculate memory score per agent
  - memory_score = (success_rate × 3.0) + (avg_importance × 0.5)
  - Apply recency: memory_score = memory_score × avg_recency_weight
  - Clamp to range [0, 5]

Step 5: Return agent_id → memory_score mapping
  - Only include agents with total_tasks >= 2 (avoid one-off noise)
  - Sort by memory_score descending
```

**Recall for Session Briefing**:

A specialized recall mode used by status.md for enriching the dashboard.

```
Recall Session Briefing:

Step 1: Check memory exists
  - If .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md does not exist: return empty briefing

Step 2: Recall recent outcomes
  - Use general recall with limit = 5, no filters
  - These are the most recent, highest-signal outcomes

Step 3: Calculate agent performance summary
  - Use the full (unfiltered) outcome set
  - Group by agent_id
  - For each agent: total tasks, success rate, average importance
  - Sort by total tasks descending
  - Return top 3 agents

Step 4: Return briefing data
  - recent_outcomes: list of 5 recent records
  - top_agents: list of 3 agent performance summaries
  - total_records: count of all records
```

---

## Section 5: Decay Rules

Decay is the mechanism that ensures recent outcomes matter more than old ones. It is computed at recall time, never applied destructively.

```
Recency Weight Formula:
  days_old = (current_date - record_date) in days

  if days_old <= 7:   recency_weight = 1.0   (full signal)
  if days_old <= 30:  recency_weight = 0.7   (recent)
  if days_old <= 90:  recency_weight = 0.4   (relevant)
  if days_old > 90:   recency_weight = 0.1   (historical)

Decay Score:
  decay_score = importance × recency_weight

  Example: importance=4, 15 days old → 4 × 0.7 = 2.8
  Example: importance=2, 60 days old → 2 × 0.4 = 0.8
  Example: importance=5, 120 days old → 5 × 0.1 = 0.5

Exclusion Threshold:
  Records with decay_score < 0.2 are excluded from recall results.
  This only affects importance=1 records older than 90 days (1 × 0.1 = 0.1 < 0.2).
  All other combinations remain above threshold.

No Auto-Deletion:
  Records are NEVER deleted by decay. They remain in OUTCOMES.md permanently.
  Decay only affects which records appear in recall results.
  Manual pruning is the user's choice, never automatic.
```

---

## Section 6: Graceful Degradation

The golden rule: every workflow that calls memory must work identically without it.

```
Caller Pattern (MUST be followed by all workflows that integrate memory):

  1. Check if .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md exists
  2. If exists:
     a. Call the appropriate recall or store operation
     b. Use the results to enhance the current operation
     c. If the memory operation fails: log a one-line warning, continue without memory
  3. If not exists:
     a. Skip the memory step entirely
     b. Do NOT create the file (only store operations create it)
     c. Do NOT display a warning or placeholder about missing memory
     d. Do NOT suggest the user set up memory
  4. NEVER:
     a. Error if memory files are missing
     b. Block workflow execution on memory operations
     c. Require memory for any workflow to function
     d. Change workflow behavior in a way that breaks without memory
     e. Add mandatory memory steps to any workflow's critical path
```

**Testing graceful degradation**:

To verify a workflow degrades gracefully:
1. Delete `.planning/memory/` entirely
2. Run the workflow (build, review, plan, status)
3. Confirm it completes successfully with no errors or warnings about memory
4. Re-run with memory present
5. Confirm memory data enhances but does not alter the core workflow result

---

## Section 7: Error Handling

- **Missing memory directory**: Store creates `.planning/memory/` on first write. Recall returns empty results. Neither operation errors.
- **Missing OUTCOMES.md**: Store creates it with the header template. Recall returns empty results.
- **Malformed OUTCOMES.md**: If the table cannot be parsed (missing columns, corrupted rows), log a one-line warning: "Warning: OUTCOMES.md could not be parsed. Proceeding without memory." Return empty results. Do NOT attempt to repair — the user should inspect manually.
- **Write failure during store**: Output the intended record as text to the user. Include all fields so the user can manually add it. Continue the workflow — memory loss is not a blocking error.
- **Excessive records (200+)**: On recall, output an informational note suggesting pruning. Never auto-prune. The note appears once per recall, not per record.
- **Concurrent writes**: Not a concern in Legion workflows — only one build/review runs at a time per project. If somehow two writes conflict, the second write wins (last-write-wins, consistent with all other Legion state files).
- **Date parsing failure**: If a record's date cannot be parsed, treat its recency_weight as 0.4 (middle of the range). Do not exclude records with unparseable dates.

## Section 8: Patterns Knowledge Base

Captures distilled wisdom from successful outcomes — what worked, under what conditions, and when to reuse it.

File path: `.planning/memory/PATTERNS.md`
Created: on first pattern store operation (not during project initialization)

**File structure:**

```markdown
# Memory — Pattern Library

Successful patterns distilled from agent outcomes. Each pattern captures what worked, under what conditions, and when to reuse it.
Managed by memory-manager skill. Do not edit manually unless curating entries.

## Patterns

| ID | Date | Branch | Pattern | Context | Reuse Criteria | Source | Tags |
|----|------|--------|---------|---------|----------------|--------|------|
| P-001 | 2026-03-01 | main | Wave-parallel testing with dedicated QA agent | Phase 5 review — QA agent found 3 issues that parallel execution missed | Use when phase has 3+ plans in a wave AND includes test-adjacent tasks | O-001 | testing, wave-execution, quality |
```

**Field definitions:**

| Field | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ID | `P-{NNN}` | Sequential, zero-padded to 3 digits |
| Date | `YYYY-MM-DD` | When the pattern was captured |
| Branch | Git branch name | Current branch at record time (via `git branch --show-current`) |
| Pattern | Free text | Brief description of the successful approach (what was done) |
| Context | Free text | The situation where this pattern proved effective (when/why it worked) |
| Reuse Criteria | Free text | Conditions under which this pattern should be applied again |
| Source | `O-{NNN}` or free text | Link to the outcome record that generated this pattern, or description |
| Tags | Comma-separated | Searchable keywords: task types, agent divisions, technologies |

**Store Pattern operation:**

```
Store Pattern:

Step 1: Check memory directory
  - If .planning/memory/ does not exist: create it with mkdir -p
  - If .planning/memory/PATTERNS.md does not exist: create it with the header template above

Step 2: Determine next ID
  - Read PATTERNS.md
  - Count rows in the Patterns table (exclude header row)
  - Next ID = P-{count + 1}, zero-padded to 3 digits

Step 3: Build the record
  - Date: current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Pattern: describe what the agent did that worked well
  - Context: describe the situation (phase, task type, constraints)
  - Reuse Criteria: under what conditions should future agents try this approach
  - Source: link to the OUTCOMES.md record ID, or describe the source
  - Tags: task-related keywords for recall matching

Step 4: Append and verify
  - Append the new row to the Patterns table
  - Write updated PATTERNS.md
  - If write fails: output the record as text (never lose data)
```

**When to store patterns:**
- After `/legion:review` passes on first cycle (the approach worked cleanly)
- After an agent resolves a complex task with a novel approach (importance ≥ 4 in OUTCOMES.md)
- After a cross-division agent succeeds (unusual pairing worth remembering)
- NOT after every success — only when the approach has learning value

**Recall Patterns operation:**

```
Recall Patterns:

Input:
  - query_tags: list of tags to filter by (optional)
  - limit: max records to return (default: 10)

Step 1: Check if .planning/memory/PATTERNS.md exists
  - If not: return empty results (do NOT create the file)

Step 2: Read and parse PATTERNS.md
  - Parse the Patterns table into individual records
  - If parse fails: log warning, return empty results

Step 3: Filter by query_tags
  - If provided: keep records where any tag matches any query_tag
  - If not provided: return all records

Step 4: Apply recency scoring
  - Same decay formula as OUTCOMES.md (Section 5):
    days_old <= 7: 1.0, <= 30: 0.7, <= 90: 0.4, > 90: 0.1
  - No importance weight (all patterns are inherently high-value)
  - Sort by recency_weight descending

Step 5: Return top {limit} records
```

## Section 9: Error Knowledge Base

Maps error signatures to known fixes — so agents encountering the same error can immediately try the solution that worked before.

File path: `.planning/memory/ERRORS.md`
Created: on first error store operation

**File structure:**

```markdown
# Memory — Error Fixes

Error signatures mapped to known fixes. When an agent encounters a matching error, it should try the documented fix before investigating from scratch.
Managed by memory-manager skill. Do not edit manually unless curating entries.

## Errors

| ID | Date | Branch | Error Signature | Fix | Agent | Resolved | Tags |
|----|------|--------|-----------------|-----|-------|----------|------|
| E-001 | 2026-03-01 | main | `TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined` in component render | Check for null/undefined data before mapping — add optional chaining or default empty array | engineering-senior-developer | true | frontend, react, null-safety |
```

**Field definitions:**

| Field | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ID | `E-{NNN}` | Sequential, zero-padded to 3 digits |
| Date | `YYYY-MM-DD` | When the error was first encountered |
| Branch | Git branch name | Current branch at record time (via `git branch --show-current`) |
| Error Signature | Free text | The error message or pattern (enough to match, not full stack trace) |
| Fix | Free text | What resolved the error (actionable, specific) |
| Agent | Agent ID | The agent that resolved it |
| Resolved | `true` / `false` | Whether the fix actually worked (false = attempted but unverified) |
| Tags | Comma-separated | Searchable keywords: technology, error category, file types |

**Store Error operation:**

```
Store Error:

Step 1: Check memory directory and file
  - If .planning/memory/ does not exist: create it with mkdir -p
  - If .planning/memory/ERRORS.md does not exist: create it with the header template above

Step 2: Check for duplicate
  - Read existing ERRORS.md
  - If an entry with a substantially similar Error Signature already exists:
    - If the existing fix worked (Resolved = true): skip store, return existing entry ID
    - If the existing fix did not work (Resolved = false): update with the new fix, set Resolved = true
  - Duplicate detection is fuzzy — match on key error terms, not exact string

Step 3: Determine next ID (using E-{NNN}, same zero-padding as PATTERNS.md)
  - Count rows in the Errors table (exclude header row)
  - Next ID = E-{count + 1}, zero-padded to 3 digits

Step 4: Build the record
  - Date: current date
  - Error Signature: the error message or pattern, trimmed to essential identifying info
  - Fix: what resolved the error (specific actions, not generic advice)
  - Agent: the agent that resolved it
  - Resolved: true if verified, false if attempted but not confirmed
  - Tags: technology, error category, affected file types

Step 5: Append and verify
  - Append the new row to the Errors table
  - Write updated ERRORS.md
  - If write fails: output the record as text (never lose data)
```

**When to store errors:**
- After an agent encounters and resolves an error during `/legion:build`
- After `/legion:review` identifies and fixes a recurring issue
- NOT for trivial errors (typos, missing imports) — only for errors that required investigation
- Error importance threshold: only store if the error took more than a trivial fix to resolve

**Recall Errors operation:**

```
Recall Errors:

Input:
  - error_text: the error message to match against (optional)
  - query_tags: list of tags to filter by (optional)
  - limit: max records to return (default: 5)

Step 1: Check if .planning/memory/ERRORS.md exists
  - If not: return empty results

Step 2: Read and parse ERRORS.md

Step 3: Match against error_text
  - If error_text provided: score each entry by keyword overlap between error_text and Error Signature
  - Rank by match score (higher = more keywords in common)
  - If query_tags also provided: AND-combine with tag filtering

Step 4: Filter by Resolved
  - Prioritize entries where Resolved = true (verified fixes)
  - Include Resolved = false entries at lower rank

Step 5: Return top {limit} records with Fix text prominently displayed
```

## Section 10: Cross-File Integration

How the four memory files work together as a unified knowledge layer.

```
Memory File Relationships:

OUTCOMES.md — Event log (raw data)
  Records individual task/review outcomes with agent, result, importance, date.
  Growing: appends every build/review cycle.
  Query pattern: "How did agent X perform on task type Y?"

PATTERNS.md — Distilled wisdom (curated knowledge)
  Captures what worked and when to reuse it, distilled from successful outcomes.
  Slower growing: only stored when an approach has genuine learning value.
  Query pattern: "What approaches have worked for task type Y?"

ERRORS.md — Fix database (troubleshooting reference)
  Maps error signatures to known fixes for faster resolution.
  Growing: appends when non-trivial errors are resolved.
  Query pattern: "Has this error been seen before? What fixed it?"

PREFERENCES.md — Decision signals (user feedback)
  Records what agents proposed and what users preferred, with positive/negative/corrective signals.
  Growing: appends when user makes a non-routine decision at a workflow decision point.
  Query pattern: "Does this user prefer agent X for task type Y? Do corrective signals cluster?"

Data flow:
  Build outcome (success) → OUTCOMES.md → distill → PATTERNS.md
  Build outcome (failure + fix) → OUTCOMES.md + ERRORS.md
  Review pass (first cycle) → OUTCOMES.md + PATTERNS.md + PREFERENCES.md (positive)
  Review pass (after fixes) → OUTCOMES.md + PREFERENCES.md (positive for fix approach)
  Review escalated (user overrides) → OUTCOMES.md + PREFERENCES.md (corrective)
  Review escalated (user rejects) → OUTCOMES.md + PREFERENCES.md (negative)
  Manual edit detected → PREFERENCES.md (corrective)

All four files:
  - Live in .planning/memory/
  - Created on first write (not during initialization)
  - Follow identical graceful degradation (Section 6)
  - Use append-only records with sequential IDs
  - Never auto-prune or auto-delete
  - Are human-readable markdown tables
  - Include Branch field for git-aware context (Section 11)
```

**Graceful degradation for all four files:**

The caller pattern from Section 6 applies identically to PATTERNS.md, ERRORS.md, and PREFERENCES.md:
- Check for file existence before any read operation
- Return empty results (not errors) when file is absent
- Only store operations create the file
- Never block workflow execution on memory availability
- Never warn the user when memory files are absent

---

## Section 11: Branch-Aware Memory

Memory files live inside the git repository at `.planning/memory/`. This means they naturally branch and merge with `git checkout` and `git merge`. This section documents how agents should be branch-aware when storing and recalling memory.

**Branch Detection:**
```
Get Current Branch:
  Run: git branch --show-current
  Result: branch name (e.g., "main", "feature/auth", "phase-33-execution")
  Fallback: if command fails or returns empty, use "unknown"
```

**Branch Field in Records:**

Add a `Branch` column to all three memory file schemas. For each store operation (OUTCOMES, PATTERNS, ERRORS), record the current git branch.

Update the OUTCOMES.md table schema (Section 2) by adding a Branch column after Date:
```
| ID | Date | Branch | Phase | Plan | Agent | Task Type | Outcome | Importance | Tags | Summary |
```

Update the PATTERNS.md table schema (Section 8) by adding a Branch column after Date:
```
| ID | Date | Branch | Pattern | Context | Reuse Criteria | Source | Tags |
```

Update the ERRORS.md table schema (Section 9) by adding a Branch column after Date:
```
| ID | Date | Branch | Error Signature | Fix | Agent | Resolved | Tags |
```

**Branch-Scoped Recall:**
```
Branch-Scoped Recall (applies to all three recall operations):

Input (additional parameter):
  - branch_filter: specific branch name, "current", or "all" (default: "all")

Behavior:
  - "all": return records from all branches (default, backwards-compatible)
  - "current": detect current branch via git, filter to matching Branch field
  - specific name: filter to records where Branch matches the given name

Why branch-scoped recall matters:
  - Feature branches may have experimental patterns that don't apply to main
  - Error fixes on a branch may not be relevant after the branch merges
  - When recalling during /legion:plan on a feature branch, branch-specific
    context is more relevant than global context

Merge behavior:
  - When branches merge, git merges the memory files naturally
  - Append-only tables merge cleanly (no field-level conflicts)
  - If a merge conflict occurs: keep both records (resolve by accepting both sides)
  - After merge: records from both branches coexist, with their original Branch values preserved
```

**Backwards Compatibility:**
- Existing records without a Branch field are treated as "main" (or whatever the default branch is)
- All recall operations work identically when branch_filter is "all" (the default)
- No migration needed — old records are valid, new records just have an extra column

---

## Section 12: Semantic Compaction

AI-summarized compaction of completed phase work. Preserves reasoning, decisions, and outcomes while trimming verbose execution details to free context for active work.

**What Gets Compacted:**
```
Compaction targets phase SUMMARY files:
  .planning/phases/{NN-name}/{NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md

These files are written by execution-tracker after each plan completes.
After a phase is fully complete (all plans executed, review passed),
the summaries can be compacted.
```

**Compaction Rules:**
```
Preserved (MUST appear in compacted summary):
  - What was done (deliverables produced, files modified)
  - Why it was done (requirements satisfied, goal addressed)
  - Key decisions made (architecture choices, trade-offs, rejected alternatives)
  - Requirements satisfied (IDs and brief descriptions)
  - Verification results (what passed, what was flagged)
  - Agent assignments (who did what)

Trimmed (can be removed):
  - Full verification command output (keep pass/fail, drop verbose output)
  - Intermediate step-by-step execution details
  - File content diffs (keep file paths and change summaries)
  - Agent execution traces and tool call details
  - Repeated context that appears in multiple summaries for the same phase

Target: compacted summary should be 30-50% of original length
  while retaining 100% of decision-relevant information
```

**Compaction Operation:**
```
Compact Phase Summaries:

Input:
  - phase_number: the completed phase to compact
  - phase_dir: .planning/phases/{NN-name}/

Preconditions:
  - Phase must be marked Complete in ROADMAP.md
  - All plan SUMMARY files must exist in the phase directory

Step 1: Read all SUMMARY files for the phase
  - Glob: .planning/phases/{NN-name}/{NN}-*-SUMMARY.md
  - Read each file fully

Step 2: Produce compacted summary
  - Combine all plan summaries into a single phase-level compacted summary
  - Apply the Preserved/Trimmed rules above
  - Write to: .planning/phases/{NN-name}/{NN}-COMPACTED.md

Step 3: Preserve originals
  - Do NOT delete or overwrite original SUMMARY files
  - The {NN}-COMPACTED.md file is an addition, not a replacement
  - Original summaries remain for detailed audit if needed

Step 4: Verify compaction quality
  - Check that every requirement ID from the phase appears in the compacted summary
  - Check that every file path from the phase appears in the compacted summary
  - If any requirement or file is missing: warn and include the missing items

Compacted file format:
  ---
  phase: {NN}-{name}
  compacted: {date}
  original_summaries: [{list of summary files}]
  requirements_satisfied: [{list of requirement IDs}]
  ---

  # Phase {N}: {name} — Compacted Summary

  ## Deliverables
  {What was built, one bullet per plan}

  ## Decisions
  {Key decisions made during execution, with rationale}

  ## Files Modified
  | File | Change |
  |------|--------|
  {Combined file table from all plan summaries}

  ## Verification
  {Pass/fail per requirement, one line each}

  ## Agents
  {Who executed what}
```

**When Compaction Runs:**
```
Compaction is triggered at two points:

1. After /legion:review passes for a phase (optional step)
   - execution-tracker Section 4 can trigger compaction after phase completion
   - Only if all plans passed and review approved the work

2. Before /legion:plan for a new phase (optional context-saving step)
   - When planning a new phase, check if previous completed phases have uncompacted summaries
   - Suggest compaction to free context: "Phase {N} has {count} uncompacted summaries. Compact now?"
   - Never auto-compact — user confirms

Compaction is always opt-in:
  - Never runs automatically
  - Never deletes originals
  - System works identically without compacted files
```

**Recall Integration:**
```
When recalling phase context (e.g., during /legion:plan or /legion:status):

1. Check if .planning/phases/{NN-name}/{NN}-COMPACTED.md exists
2. If yes: use the compacted summary (smaller, faster to read)
3. If no: fall back to reading individual SUMMARY files
4. If detailed audit needed: always read original SUMMARY files regardless of compaction
```

## Section 13: Preference Pairs

Captures user decision signals — what agents proposed and whether the user accepted, rejected, or modified the proposal — enabling preference-informed routing in future planning.

File path: `.planning/memory/PREFERENCES.md`
Created: on first preference store operation (not during project initialization)

**File structure:**

```markdown
# Memory — User Preferences

Decision signals from user interactions with agent proposals. Each record captures what was proposed, what the user chose, and the preference signal. Used by /legion:plan to improve agent and approach recommendations.
Managed by memory-manager skill. Do not edit manually unless curating entries.

## Preferences

| ID | Date | Branch | Decision Point | Context | Proposed | User Choice | Signal | Agent | Tags |
|----|------|--------|---------------|---------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|------|
| D-001 | 2026-03-02 | main | review-verdict | Phase 5 review cycle 1 — testing-reality-checker found 2 blockers | 2 blockers requiring fixes in auth module | Accepted — ran fix cycle, review passed on cycle 2 | positive | testing-reality-checker | review, testing, auth |
```

**Field definitions:**

| Field | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ID | `D-{NNN}` | Sequential, zero-padded to 3 digits |
| Date | `YYYY-MM-DD` | When the preference was captured |
| Branch | string | Git branch at capture time (via `git branch --show-current`) |
| Decision Point | enum-like | Category of decision: `review-verdict`, `review-override`, `agent-selection`, `manual-edit`, `fix-acceptance` |
| Context | Free text | Phase, plan, cycle, and situation description |
| Proposed | Free text | What the agent or system proposed (brief summary, not full content) |
| User Choice | Free text | What the user actually did (accepted, rejected, modified, selected alternative) |
| Signal | enum | `positive` (accepted as proposed), `negative` (rejected), `corrective` (accepted with modifications) |
| Agent | Agent ID or "system" | The agent whose proposal was being evaluated |
| Tags | Comma-separated | Searchable keywords: decision type, agent division, phase type |

**Store Preference operation:**

```
Store Preference:

Step 1: Check memory directory
  - If .planning/memory/ does not exist: create it with mkdir -p
  - If .planning/memory/PREFERENCES.md does not exist: create it with the header template

Step 2: Determine next ID
  - Read PREFERENCES.md
  - Count rows in the Preferences table (exclude header row)
  - Next ID = D-{count + 1}, zero-padded to 3 digits

Step 3: Get current branch
  - Run: git branch --show-current
  - If command fails or returns empty: use "unknown"

Step 4: Build the record
  - Date: current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Branch: from Step 3
  - Decision Point: one of: review-verdict, review-override, agent-selection,
    manual-edit, fix-acceptance
  - Context: describe the phase, plan, cycle, and situation
  - Proposed: what was proposed (summarize, don't include full content)
  - User Choice: what the user chose to do
  - Signal: positive (accepted), negative (rejected), corrective (modified)
  - Agent: agent ID that made the proposal, or "system" for system-level decisions
  - Tags: decision type, agent division, relevant phase type keywords

Step 5: Append and verify
  - Append the new row to the Preferences table
  - Write updated PREFERENCES.md
  - If write fails: output the record as text (never lose data)
```

**When to store preferences:**
- After `/legion:review` passes (positive signal for the review approach and agents)
- After user selects "Accept as-is" despite unresolved blockers (corrective signal — user overrides review)
- After user selects "Fix manually" from escalation (negative signal — automated fixes insufficient)
- After manual edits to build-modified files are detected (corrective signal — user improved agent output)
- NOT for routine decisions like "Execute all plans" (low signal value)
- NOT for system confirmations like "Create PR?" (infrastructure choice, not preference)

**Recall Preferences operation:**

```
Recall Preferences:

Input:
  - signal_filter: "positive", "negative", "corrective", or "all" (default: "all")
  - decision_point_filter: specific decision point type, or "all" (default: "all")
  - query_tags: list of tags to filter by (optional)
  - agent_filter: specific agent ID (optional)
  - branch_filter: specific branch, "current", or "all" (default: "all")
  - limit: max records to return (default: 10)

Step 1: Check if .planning/memory/PREFERENCES.md exists
  - If not: return empty results (do NOT create the file)

Step 2: Read and parse PREFERENCES.md
  - Parse the Preferences table into individual records
  - If parse fails: log warning, return empty results

Step 3: Apply filters
  - signal_filter: keep records matching the signal type
  - decision_point_filter: keep records matching the decision point
  - query_tags: keep records where any tag matches any query_tag
  - agent_filter: keep records where Agent matches
  - branch_filter: "all" (default), "current" (detect via git), or specific name

Step 4: Apply recency scoring
  - Same decay formula as OUTCOMES.md (Section 5):
    days_old <= 7: 1.0, <= 30: 0.7, <= 90: 0.4, > 90: 0.1
  - Sort by recency_weight descending

Step 5: Return top {limit} records
```

**Using Preferences for Routing Improvement:**

```
During /legion:plan agent recommendation:

1. Recall preferences with agent_filter for each candidate agent
2. Count positive vs. negative vs. corrective signals per agent
3. Compute preference score:
   - positive signals: +1 each (agent's proposals were accepted)
   - corrective signals: +0.5 each (agent was useful but needed adjustment)
   - negative signals: -1 each (agent's proposals were rejected)
4. Apply as a modifier to the existing agent recommendation score:
   - preference_boost = (sum of preference scores) * 0.5
   - Add to the base recommendation score from agent-registry Section 3
5. This is a soft signal — never exclude an agent based solely on preferences
   (user may have rejected a proposal for situational reasons, not agent quality)

During /legion:plan approach suggestion:

1. Recall preferences with decision_point_filter: "review-verdict"
2. Look for patterns: do corrective signals cluster around specific task types or approaches?
3. Surface as a note: "Previous preference signals suggest {pattern} for {task type}"
4. This is advisory — never auto-select an approach based on preferences
```

## Section 14: Claude Code Memory Alignment

Documents how Legion's memory system relates to Claude Code's built-in memory, defines the boundary between them, and specifies integration rules.

### Two Memory Systems

Legion projects operate with two complementary memory systems:

| Property | Claude Code Memory | Legion Memory |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Location** | `~/.claude/projects/{project}/memory/MEMORY.md` | `.planning/memory/` (OUTCOMES, PATTERNS, ERRORS, PREFERENCES) |
| **Managed by** | Claude Code platform (auto-managed) | Legion workflows (explicit store/recall calls) |
| **Scope** | Platform-level — user preferences, project conventions, cross-session context | Agent orchestration-specific — performance data, error fixes, decision signals |
| **Audience** | Claude Code itself (informs Claude's responses across all tools) | Legion commands (informs agent selection, pattern recall, error lookup) |
| **Lifecycle** | Auto-populated by platform; persists across sessions | Created on first Legion store operation; grows via build/review cycles |
| **Git-tracked** | No (lives outside project directory) | Yes (lives in `.planning/memory/`, committed with project) |
| **Branch-aware** | No (single global file per project) | Yes (branches and merges with git operations) |

### Why They Coexist

These systems are complementary, not competing:

- **Claude Code memory** captures general user preferences and project patterns that apply across ALL tools and workflows. It is the platform's ambient understanding of the user and project.
- **Legion memory** captures structured agent orchestration data — which agents performed well on which task types, what error fixes work, what patterns to reuse. This data is specific to Legion's agent routing and has no value to the platform at large.

Merging them would conflate two different audiences. Claude Code memory informs Claude's general responses; Legion memory informs agent selection and workflow decisions. Keeping them separate ensures each system operates with high signal-to-noise ratio.

### Integration Rules

```
Rule 1: Legion MAY READ from Claude Code memory
  When: During /legion:plan agent recommendation or /legion:quick task routing
  How: Check if ~/.claude/projects/{project}/memory/MEMORY.md exists
       If yes: read it for user preferences that may inform agent selection
       (e.g., "user prefers minimal code", "user dislikes verbose output")
       If no: skip silently (standard graceful degradation)
  Use: As a soft signal — same role as memory_boost in agent-registry scoring

Rule 2: Legion MUST NOT WRITE to Claude Code memory
  Why: Claude Code memory is platform-managed. Writing to it from Legion
       would create confusing entries that the platform didn't generate.
       Let the platform manage its own memory lifecycle.

Rule 3: Legion MUST NOT DUPLICATE into Claude Code memory
  Why: Legion's four-file structure (OUTCOMES, PATTERNS, ERRORS, PREFERENCES)
       is optimized for agent routing. Duplicating into a different format
       adds maintenance burden with no benefit.

Rule 4: Absence of either system is non-blocking
  Behavior: If Claude Code memory doesn't exist — skip silently.
            If Legion memory doesn't exist — skip silently.
            Both systems follow identical graceful degradation (Section 6).
```

### Reading Claude Code Memory (Optional Enhancement)

When a workflow already reads Legion memory for agent scoring, it may optionally also check Claude Code memory for additional context:

```
Enhanced Agent Recommendation (during /legion:plan):

Step 1: Standard recall from .planning/memory/ (existing behavior)
  - Recall agent scores from OUTCOMES.md
  - Recall patterns from PATTERNS.md
  - Recall preferences from PREFERENCES.md

Step 2: Optional Claude Code memory read (enhancement)
  - Check: does ~/.claude/projects/{project}/memory/MEMORY.md exist?
  - If no: skip to Step 3
  - If yes: read the file and scan for:
    a. User coding preferences (style, verbosity, framework preferences)
    b. Project-specific patterns the user has established
    c. Any preferences that map to agent capabilities
  - Extract as: claude_code_context (free text, max ~500 tokens)

Step 3: Combine signals
  - Legion memory provides: agent scores, pattern matches, preference boosts
  - Claude Code memory provides: user context that may refine agent selection
  - Claude Code context is advisory only — it does not modify numeric scores
  - Present as a note: "Claude Code memory suggests: {relevant preference}"
```

### Boundaries Summary

| Action | Allowed? | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Read Claude Code memory during planning | Yes | Soft signal for agent selection |
| Write to Claude Code memory from Legion | No | Platform manages its own memory |
| Duplicate Legion data to Claude Code memory | No | Different format, different audience |
| Block on Claude Code memory absence | No | Graceful degradation always applies |
| Read Legion memory (standard behavior) | Yes | Core functionality of this skill |
| Store to Legion memory (standard behavior) | Yes | Core functionality of this skill |
