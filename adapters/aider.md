# Aider Adapter

Aider is a single-agent pair programming tool. No subagent spawning, no teams, no MCP (as of early 2026). Personality injection works as a prompt prefix in the current session. All execution is sequential and single-session.

## Tool Mappings

| Generic Concept | Implementation |
|-----------------|---------------|
| `spawn_agent_personality` | No subagent spawning. Prepend the personality content to the current session context, then execute the plan tasks inline using `/code` mode. |
| `spawn_agent_autonomous` | Execute the plan tasks directly in `/code` mode. |
| `spawn_agent_readonly` | Switch to `/ask` mode — Aider's ask mode does not modify files. Provide personality + task in the prompt. |
| `coordinate_parallel` | Not available. All plans execute sequentially. |
| `collect_results` | After each plan, write a structured result to `.planning/phases/{NN}/{NN}-{PP}-RESULT.md`. |
| `shutdown_agents` | No-op. |
| `cleanup_coordination` | No-op. |
| `ask_user` | Print numbered choices in plain text and wait for user input. |
| `model_planning` | User-configured architect model (e.g., `claude-opus-4-6`, `o1`) |
| `model_execution` | User-configured editor model (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `deepseek-v3`) |
| `model_check` | User-configured lightweight model (e.g., `claude-haiku-4-5`, `o1-mini`) |
| `global_config_dir` | `~/.legion/` |
| `plugin_discovery_glob` | `{HOME}/.config/aider/plugins/**/legion/**/agents/agents-orchestrator.md` (expand `{HOME}` via `echo $HOME` — Glob tools do not expand `~`) |
| `commit_signature` | `Co-Authored-By: Aider <noreply@aider.chat>` |

## Interaction Protocol

Print numbered choices in plain text and wait for user response. Parse the integer from the user's message. Re-prompt on invalid input (max 2 retries).

## Execution Protocol

### Phase Initialization

Write a wave checklist to `.planning/phases/{NN}/WAVE-CHECKLIST.md`.

### Wave Execution

All plans execute sequentially in the current session:
1. For each plan in the wave:
   a. Read the plan file
   b. If assigned agent: read personality file, adopt as behavioral context
   c. Use `/code` mode to execute the plan's implementation tasks
   d. After each task, verify using the plan's verification commands
   e. Write result to `.planning/phases/{NN}/{NN}-{PP}-RESULT.md`
2. Update WAVE-CHECKLIST.md

### Architect Mode Integration

Aider's architect mode (a reasoning model plans, then an editor model implements) aligns naturally with Legion's planning/execution split:
- `/architect` mode can be used for `/legion:plan` phases — the reasoning model generates plans
- `/code` mode handles `/legion:build` execution

### Limitations

- **No file context injection**: Files must be added manually via `/add`
- **No shell execution**: Aider cannot run verification commands directly — the user must run them
- **No MCP support**: Cannot extend with external tool servers
- **Weakest personality isolation**: Single session with no context separation between plans

### Result Collection

Read result files after each plan. Parse Status field.

### Phase Cleanup

No cleanup needed. Update checklist.
