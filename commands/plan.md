<process>
1. PARSE PHASE NUMBER
   - Read $ARGUMENTS for a phase number (e.g., "3" from `/agency:plan 3`)
   - If no phase number given: auto-detect the next unplanned phase
     - Read ROADMAP.md progress table
     - Find the first phase where Status = "Pending" and Completed = 0
     - Use that phase number
   - Validate: phase number must exist in ROADMAP.md
   - If invalid: error with "Phase {N} doesn't exist. ROADMAP.md has {count} phases."

2. CHECK FOR EXISTING PLANS
   - Construct the phase directory path using workflow-common conventions:
     `.planning/phases/{NN}-{phase-slug}/`
   - Check if any {NN}-{PP}-PLAN.md files already exist in that directory
   - If plans exist: use AskUserQuestion
     - "Phase {N} already has {count} plan(s). What would you like to do?"
     - Option 1: "Re-plan from scratch" -- delete existing plans, proceed
     - Option 2: "Keep existing plans" -- abort, suggest /agency:build instead
   - If no plans exist: proceed directly

3. READ PHASE DETAILS
   Follow phase-decomposer skill Section 2 (Phase Analysis):
   - Read ROADMAP.md and extract phase goal, requirements list, success criteria
   - If .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md exists, read it and cross-reference full requirement descriptions
   - If REQUIREMENTS.md is absent (between milestones), rely on ROADMAP.md requirement summaries and note the limitation
   - Read PROJECT.md for broader context
   - Read STATE.md for current progress and completed phase outputs
   - If this phase builds on prior phases, read prior phase summaries

   BROWNFIELD CONTEXT (optional — follows codebase-mapper Section 6.2):
   - Check if .planning/CODEBASE.md exists
   - If yes:
     a. Read .planning/CODEBASE.md
     b. Check the "Analyzed" date in the header
        - If >30 days old: warn user "CODEBASE.md was analyzed {N} days ago. Consider running /agency:start to refresh the codebase map."
        - Do NOT auto-re-analyze — let user decide. Continue with existing data.
     c. Extract these sections for use in step 4 (decomposition) and step 5 (agent recommendation):
        - Risk Areas table — flag risks that overlap with files this phase will modify
        - Agent Guidance — Preferred/Avoid/Touch-with-care patterns for task instructions
        - Conventions Detected — naming, structure, and config patterns agents should follow
        - Detected Stack — framework and test suite context for agent instructions
     d. When generating plan tasks in step 4, include codebase context:
        - Note risk areas that tasks touch in the task action instructions
        - Add "Follow codebase conventions" note referencing detected patterns
        - Include "Touch with care" warnings for flagged files
   - If no:
     Skip silently (greenfield project or user declined analysis)

   MARKETING PHASE DETECTION (optional — follows marketing-workflows Section 1):
   - Run marketing domain detection on the current phase:
     a. Check if phase requirements include MKT-* IDs
     b. Check if phase description contains marketing keywords
        ("campaign", "content calendar", "social media", "cross-channel", "marketing",
         "brand awareness", "audience", "engagement strategy")
   - If marketing phase detected:
     a. Read marketing-workflows skill for domain-specific patterns
     b. In step 4 (decomposition), use marketing-specific wave pattern:
        Wave 1: Strategy & Planning (Social Media Strategist + Growth Hacker)
        Wave 2: Content Creation (Content Creator + Channel Specialists)
        Wave 3 (optional): Distribution (all channel agents)
     c. In step 5 (agent recommendation), use marketing team assembly pattern:
        Required: Strategy Lead + Content Lead
        Per-channel: one specialist per selected channel
     d. Before generating plan files, run campaign brief questioning
        (marketing-workflows Section 2.1) and generate campaign document
        at .planning/campaigns/{campaign-slug}.md
     e. All plan files reference the campaign document in their context section
   - If not marketing phase:
     Skip silently (standard decomposition applies)

   DESIGN PHASE DETECTION (optional — follows design-workflows Section 1):
   - Run design domain detection on the current phase:
     a. Check if phase requirements include DSN-* IDs
     b. Check if phase description contains design keywords
        ("design system", "component library", "UX research", "usability testing",
         "accessibility audit", "brand guidelines", "design tokens", "wireframes",
         "user persona", "user journey", "information architecture", "visual design")
   - If design phase detected:
     a. Read design-workflows skill for domain-specific patterns
     b. In step 4 (decomposition), use design-specific wave pattern:
        Wave 1: Research & Foundation (UX Researcher + Brand Guardian)
        Wave 2: Design System & Creation (UI Designer + UX Architect + Visual Storyteller)
        Wave 3 (optional): Polish & Validation (Whimsy Injector + review agents)
     c. In step 5 (agent recommendation), use design team assembly pattern:
        Required: Design Lead (design-ui-designer) + Research Lead (design-ux-researcher)
        Per-discipline: specialist per relevant discipline
     d. Before generating plan files, run design brief questioning
        (design-workflows Section 2.1) and generate design documents
        at .planning/designs/{project-slug}-system.md
     e. All plan files reference the design documents in their context section
   - If not design phase:
     Skip silently (standard decomposition applies)

4. DECOMPOSE INTO PLANS
   Follow phase-decomposer skill Section 3 (Task Decomposition):
   - List all deliverables from phase requirements
   - Identify dependency layers
   - Map layers to waves
   - Group deliverables into plans (max 3 tasks per plan)
   - Validate: every requirement covered, no circular dependencies

5. RECOMMEND AGENTS
   Follow phase-decomposer skill Section 4 (Agent Recommendation):
   - For each plan, analyze task types and match against agent-registry
   - Score and rank candidates
   - Select 1-2 agents per plan (or mark as autonomous)
   - Apply mandatory roles (testing for code, coordinator for cross-division)

6. PRESENT TO USER FOR CONFIRMATION
   Follow phase-decomposer skill Section 5 (User Confirmation Gate):
   - Display the complete plan breakdown with wave structure
   - Show agent recommendations with rationale per plan
   - Show agent summary table
   - Use AskUserQuestion: "Does this plan breakdown look right?"
     - "Looks good, generate the plans" -- proceed
     - "Swap an agent" -- ask which plan, present alternatives, update
     - "Adjust the plan structure" -- discuss changes, revise decomposition
   - Loop until user confirms

7. GENERATE CONTEXT FILE
   Follow phase-decomposer skill Section 7 (Context File Generation):
   - Create `.planning/phases/{NN}-{phase-slug}/` directory
   - Write `{NN}-CONTEXT.md` with phase goal, requirements, existing assets, decisions, plan structure

8. GENERATE PLAN FILES
   Follow phase-decomposer skill Section 6 (Plan File Template):
   - For each plan, generate a `{NN}-{PP}-PLAN.md` file
   - Include complete YAML frontmatter (phase, plan, wave, depends_on, must_haves, etc.)
   - Include all XML sections (objective, context, tasks, verification, success_criteria, output)
   - Each task has detailed action instructions, verify commands, and done sentence
   - Context references include prior plan summaries for wave 2+ plans

8.5. PLAN CRITIQUE (optional)
   After plan files are generated, offer the user a chance to stress-test:

   Use AskUserQuestion:
   "Plans generated. Stress-test before execution?"
   Options:
   - "Run plan critique (Recommended for complex phases)" — run pre-mortem + assumption hunting
     Description: "Two skeptical agents analyze the plan for failure modes and unexamined assumptions"
   - "Skip critique, proceed to execution" — skip directly to state update
     Description: "Plans look straightforward, no need for extra validation"

   If user selects "Run plan critique":
   a. Select critique agents using plan-critique Section 4 (Agent Selection):
      - Compose a task description from phase goal + requirements
      - Run agent-registry recommendation with skeptical bias terms
      - Default: testing-reality-checker (pre-mortem) + product-sprint-prioritizer (assumptions)
      - Present selection to user for confirmation (same pattern as review panel)

   b. Spawn critique agents (read-only):
      - Use subagent_type "Explore" (no Write/Edit tools)
      - Agent 1 runs plan-critique Section 1 (Pre-Mortem Analysis)
      - Agent 2 runs plan-critique Section 2 (Assumption Hunting)
      - For quick critique (1 agent): single agent runs both sections sequentially

   c. Collect findings and synthesize (plan-critique Section 3):
      - Merge pre-mortem risks and assumption findings
      - Compute critique verdict (PASS / CAUTION / REWORK)
      - Present consolidated report to user

   d. Route based on verdict (plan-critique Section 3, Step 4):
      - PASS: proceed to Step 9
      - CAUTION: user chooses to apply mitigations or proceed
      - REWORK: user chooses to revise plans or proceed anyway

   If user selects "Skip critique": proceed directly to Step 9

9. GITHUB ISSUE CREATION (optional)
   Follow github-sync Section 8 (Graceful Degradation) caller pattern:
   - Check GitHub availability: gh auth status && git remote get-url origin
   - If github_available is false: skip to step 10

   If github_available is true:
   a. Ensure "agency" label exists (github-sync Section 2.1)
   b. If ROADMAP.md has milestones and the current phase falls within a milestone range:
      - Check if the GitHub milestone exists (github-sync Section 4.1)
      - If not: create it
   c. Create a GitHub issue for the phase (github-sync Section 2.2):
      - Title: "Phase {N}: {phase_name}"
      - Body: phase goal, plans checklist, requirements, success criteria
      - Label: "agency"
      - Milestone: GitHub milestone title (if available)
   d. Store the issue number in STATE.md ## GitHub section (github-sync Section 6)
   e. Confirm to user: "Created GitHub issue #{number} for Phase {N}: {phase_name}"

10. UPDATE STATE
   - Read current .planning/STATE.md
   - Update:
     - Phase: {N} of {total} (planned)
     - Status: Phase {N} planned -- {plan_count} plans across {wave_count} waves
     - Last Activity: Phase {N} planning ({date})
     - Next Action: Run `/agency:build` to execute Phase {N}: {phase_name}
   - Write updated STATE.md

11. DISPLAY SUMMARY
    - Show the user a concise summary:
      - Phase: {N} -- {phase_name}
      - Plans: {count} plans across {wave_count} waves
      - For each plan: name, wave, assigned agent(s)
      - Files to be created: list the plan file paths
    - End with: "Run `/agency:build` to execute Phase {N}: {phase_name}"
    - Do NOT dump full plan file contents -- summary only
</process>
