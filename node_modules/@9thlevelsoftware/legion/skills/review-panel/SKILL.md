# Review Panel

Composes context-aware multi-perspective review teams from the 51-agent pool. Each reviewer evaluates through domain-specific weighted rubrics with non-overlapping criteria. Produces a synthesized consolidated report.

Used by `/legion:review` when panel mode is selected. Replaces the static phase-type-to-agent mapping with dynamic selection via agent-registry recommendation algorithm.

## Section 1: Panel Composition Algorithm

How to assemble a review panel dynamically based on what's being reviewed.

```
Input: Phase CONTEXT.md content, SUMMARY.md content, files_modified list
Output: Ordered list of 2-4 reviewer agents with assigned rubrics

Step 1: Extract review signals from phase artifacts
  Read the phase CONTEXT.md and all SUMMARY.md files. Extract:
  - Primary domains touched (engineering, design, marketing, testing, product, infrastructure)
  - File types produced (.md, .ts, .js, .css, .py, config files, etc.)
  - Keywords from phase goal and task descriptions
  - Combine into a composite task description for the recommendation algorithm

Step 2: Score agents using agent-registry Section 3
  Pass the composite task description to the agent-registry recommendation algorithm:
  - Step 1: Parse extracted keywords as task terms
  - Step 2: Match agents — exact (3 pts), partial (1 pt), division (2 pts)
  - Step 3: Rank by score, break ties by specificity
  - Step 4.5: Apply memory boost if OUTCOMES.md exists

Step 3: Filter to review-capable agents
  From the ranked list, keep only agents whose specialty includes evaluation,
  review, quality, testing, or validation capabilities. Eligible agents:

  Testing division (all 7):
  - testing-reality-checker, testing-evidence-collector, testing-api-tester
  - testing-workflow-optimizer, testing-performance-benchmarker
  - testing-test-results-analyzer, testing-tool-evaluator

  Design division (review-capable):
  - design-brand-guardian, design-ux-architect, design-ux-researcher

  Engineering division (review-capable):
  - engineering-senior-developer, engineering-backend-architect
  - engineering-frontend-developer, engineering-devops-automator

  Product division (review-capable):
  - product-sprint-prioritizer, product-feedback-synthesizer

  Project Management (review-capable):
  - project-manager-senior, project-management-project-shepherd

  If an agent from a non-review-capable role (e.g., marketing-tiktok-creator,
  spatial-computing-xr-immersive-designer) scores highly, skip it and take the
  next eligible agent.

Step 4: Cap panel size and enforce diversity
  - 2 reviewers: single-domain phase (only one division touched)
  - 3 reviewers: standard phase (2 divisions involved)
  - 4 reviewers: cross-domain phase (3+ divisions involved)

  Diversity rule: no more than 2 reviewers from the same division.
  If 3+ agents from Testing score highest, keep the top 2 and pull the
  next-highest from a different division.

  Mandatory: at least one Testing division agent on every panel.
  This inherits from agent-registry Step 5 (Mandatory Roles) and from
  the existing review-loop principle that testing-reality-checker is
  always included.

Step 5: Assign rubrics
  For each selected reviewer, look up their domain rubric from Section 2.
  The rubric is keyed by agent ID. If no specific rubric exists for an agent,
  use the division default rubric.

Step 6: Present panel to user for confirmation
  Display the composed panel via AskUserQuestion:

  ## Phase {N}: {phase_name} — Review Panel

  **Panel Size**: {count} reviewers (based on {domain_count} domain(s) detected)
  **Domains Detected**: {comma-separated domains}

  | # | Agent | Division | Rubric Focus | Score |
  |---|-------|----------|--------------|-------|
  | 1 | {agent-id} | {division} | {rubric_name} | {score} pts |
  | 2 | {agent-id} | {division} | {rubric_name} | {score} pts |

  **Why this panel**: {1-sentence rationale linking detected domains to selected agents}

  Options:
  - "Use this panel" (Recommended)
  - "Add a reviewer" — add one more agent from the ranked list (up to max 4)
  - "Replace a reviewer" — swap one reviewer for an alternative
  - "Other" — enter custom agent IDs

  If user selects "Add a reviewer": show next-ranked eligible agent, confirm
  If user selects "Replace a reviewer": show which reviewer to replace and alternatives
  If user selects "Other": accept custom agent IDs, validate each exists, assign default rubric
```

## Section 2: Domain Rubric Registry

Non-overlapping evaluation criteria for each reviewer specialty. Each rubric defines what that reviewer checks — and implicitly, what they do NOT check (that's another reviewer's rubric).

### How Rubrics Work

A rubric is a set of 3-5 evaluation criteria injected into the review prompt alongside the reviewer's personality. Each criterion has a name and description. The reviewer evaluates ONLY against their assigned criteria, producing findings scoped to their domain lens.

Rubrics are injected into the review prompt as an additional section AFTER the standard review instructions from review-loop Section 3 and BEFORE the "Required Feedback Format" section:

```
## Your Domain Rubric — {rubric_name}

Evaluate ONLY against these criteria. Other aspects are covered by fellow panel reviewers.

| # | Criterion | What to Check |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | {name}    | {description} |
| 2 | {name}    | {description} |
...

For each finding, tag it with the criterion number: "**Criterion**: {N} — {criterion_name}"

## Confidence Requirement

For EVERY finding, you MUST rate your confidence:
- **HIGH (80-100%)**: Certain this is a real issue based on evidence in the code/content
- **MEDIUM (50-79%)**: Suspect an issue but can't fully confirm — flag it but it may be deferred
- **LOW (<50%)**: Uncertain — do NOT report this finding

Only HIGH-confidence findings are actioned. Rate conservatively — a false positive wastes more time than a missed MEDIUM finding that surfaces in the next review.

Include in each finding: `- **Confidence**: {HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW} — {percentage}%`
```

## Section 3: Panel Result Synthesis

How to consolidate findings from multiple panel reviewers into a unified report.

```
After all panel reviewers submit findings (per adapter.collect_results):

Step 1: Collect and parse
  Same as review-loop Section 4 (Feedback Collection):
  - Parse Finding blocks from each reviewer
  - Record for each finding:
    - Finding number
    - File path
    - Line/section reference
    - Severity (BLOCKER, WARNING, or SUGGESTION)
    - Confidence (HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW with percentage)
    - Issue (one-sentence description)
    - Suggested fix
    - Reviewer agent ID
    - Criterion tag (from rubric)

Step 2: Deduplicate across reviewers
  Same deduplication rules as review-loop Section 4, Step 2:
  - Same file + same line/section: keep highest severity
  - Same file + different lines: keep both
  - Severity disagreement on same issue: escalate to BLOCKER

Step 2.5: Filter by confidence
  - HIGH-confidence findings (80%+): include in synthesis
  - MEDIUM-confidence findings (50-79%): collect into "Deferred" section
  - LOW-confidence findings: discard
  - When deduplicating findings with different confidence levels from different
    reviewers, keep the HIGHER confidence rating (if one reviewer is HIGH and
    another is MEDIUM on the same finding, it's HIGH)

Step 3: Group by domain lens
  Organize findings by each reviewer's rubric focus area:

  ### {Rubric Name} — {agent-id}
  **Verdict**: {PASS | NEEDS WORK | FAIL}

  | # | Severity | File | Criterion | Issue |
  |---|----------|------|-----------|-------|
  | 1 | BLOCKER  | path | {criterion_name} | {issue} |

Step 4: Identify cross-cutting themes
  Scan across all domain groupings for patterns:
  - Multiple reviewers flagging the same file (from different criteria) → "Hot spot"
  - Findings clustering around the same success criterion → "Criterion at risk"
  - All reviewers passing a particular area → "Strong area"

  ### Cross-Cutting Themes
  - **Hot spots**: Files flagged by 2+ reviewers: {file list with finding counts}
  - **Criteria at risk**: Success criteria with 2+ findings against them: {list}
  - **Strong areas**: Aspects with no findings from any reviewer: {list}

Step 5: Compute aggregate verdict
  - PASS: No BLOCKERs, no WARNINGs, all reviewers gave PASS
  - NEEDS WORK: Has BLOCKERs or WARNINGs, at least one reviewer gave NEEDS WORK
  - FAIL: Any reviewer gave FAIL, or 3+ BLOCKERs across reviewers

Step 6: Produce consolidated report
  Display the synthesis to the user:

  ## Review Panel Synthesis — Phase {N}: {phase_name}

  **Panel**: {count} reviewers across {domains} domain(s)
  **Aggregate Verdict**: {PASS | NEEDS WORK | FAIL}

  ### Summary
  | Metric | Count |
  |--------|-------|
  | Total findings | {N} |
  | Blockers | {N} |
  | Warnings | {N} |
  | Suggestions | {N} |

  {Domain lens groupings from Step 3}

  {Cross-cutting themes from Step 4}

  ### Panel Verdicts
  | Reviewer | Rubric Focus | Verdict | Key Finding |
  |----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
  | {agent-id} | {rubric_name} | {verdict} | {most critical finding or "No issues"} |

  ### Deferred Findings (MEDIUM Confidence)
  {count} findings were flagged at MEDIUM confidence (50-79%) and excluded from
  the actionable report. These may warrant review if HIGH-confidence findings
  are sparse or if the user requests the full report.

  | # | Confidence | Reviewer | File | Issue |
  |---|------------|----------|------|-------|
  | 1 | MEDIUM (65%) | {agent-id} | path | {issue} |

  The aggregate verdict and must-fix list then feed back into the standard
  review-loop cycle (Section 5: Fix Cycle if NEEDS WORK, Section 7 if PASS,
  Section 8 if escalated after 3 cycles).
```
