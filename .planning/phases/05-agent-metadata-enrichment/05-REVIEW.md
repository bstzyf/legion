## Findings Detail

| # | Severity | File | Issue | Fix Applied | Cycle Fixed |
|---|----------|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | WARNING | `agents/polymath.md` | Non-standard frontmatter field ordering (`division` at end) | Reordered to match standard: name, description, division, color, metadata | 1 |
| 2 | WARNING | `skills/agent-registry/SKILL.md:166` | Phantom agent refs (`marketing-tiktok-strategist`, `marketing-reddit-community-builder`) | Replaced with existing agents (`marketing-app-store-optimizer`, `marketing-growth-hacker`) | 1 |
| 3 | SUGGESTION | `tests/agent-contract.test.js:64-73` | `parseFrontmatter` should document inline YAML flow sequence assumption | Not required — suggestion only | — |
| 4 | SUGGESTION | `agents/visionos-spatial-engineer.md` | `swiftui` appears in both `languages` and `frameworks` | Not required — SwiftUI code is Swift; dual-listing acceptable | — |
| 5 | SUGGESTION | `tests/agent-contract.test.js` | Positive: well-structured constants, focused tests, documented schema | N/A — positive observation | — |

## Reviewer Verdicts

| Reviewer | Rubric Focus | Verdict | Key Observations |
|----------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| testing-reality-checker | Production Readiness | PASS | All 53 agents verified, metadata accurate across 10 spot-checks, parseFrontmatter handles CRLF and real files correctly |
| testing-evidence-collector | Verification Completeness | PASS | Test suite reproducible, git diffs confirm frontmatter-only changes (212 insertions, 0 deletions), accuracy verified on 6 agents across 6 divisions |
| engineering-senior-developer | Code Architecture | PASS | No copy-paste metadata detected, all 53 agents have distinct combinations, test code well-structured with extracted constants |

## Suggestions (noted, not required)

1. **parseFrontmatter documentation**: Add a comment noting that empty arrays `[]` and multiline YAML syntax are intentionally unsupported. The completeness gate test catches any format drift.
2. **swiftui dual-listing**: `visionos-spatial-engineer.md` lists `swiftui` in both `languages` and `frameworks`. Technically SwiftUI is a framework, but SwiftUI code IS Swift code. Cosmetic only.

## Evidence

- `node --test tests/agent-contract.test.js` → 4/4 pass, 0 fail
- `git diff 28dfb5a..33ffd9d --stat -- agents/` → 53 files changed, 212 insertions, 0 deletions
- 10+ agents spot-checked for metadata accuracy across all 9 divisions
- 5 agents verified for personality text integrity (no changes below frontmatter)

## Cycle Delta

Not applicable — review passed in cycle 1.
