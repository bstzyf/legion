## Findings Detail

| # | Severity | File | Issue | Fix Applied | Cycle |
|---|----------|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | BLOCKER | commands/build.md | Step numbering collision in NL section | Renamed to Step 0.7, lettered sub-steps | 1 |
| 2 | BLOCKER | commands/review.md | Same step numbering collision | Same fix + removed leading space | 1 |
| 3 | WARNING | commands/build.md | NL section had no step number | Covered by Step 0.7 rename | 1 |
| 4 | WARNING | commands/review.md | Same missing step number | Covered by Step 0.7 rename | 1 |
| 5 | WARNING | commands/build.md | HIGH confidence cross-command EXIT dead end | Added adapter.ask_user with 3 options | 1 |
| 6 | WARNING | commands/review.md | Same dead-end EXIT | Same fix | 1 |
| 7 | WARNING | skills/intent-router/SKILL.md | Substring keyword matching false positives | Word-boundary regex matching | 1 |
| 8 | WARNING | skills/intent-router/SKILL.md | needs_planning position unreachable | Merged into phase_complete | 1 |
| 9 | WARNING | skills/intent-router/SKILL.md | needs_review detection fragile | Moved above phase_complete, added "pending review" | 1 |
| 10 | WARNING | intent-teams.yaml | Missing fix:0.4 in review keywords | Added fix: 0.4 | 1 |
| 11 | SUGGESTION | intent-teams.yaml | No unknown position in context_rules | Added with safe defaults | 1 |
| 12 | SUGGESTION | intent-teams.yaml | harden/security-only keyword overlap | Not fixed — documented as intentional | - |
| 13 | SUGGESTION | commands/status.md | Step 5 vs 5b relationship unclear | Not fixed — ordering is sensible as-is | - |
| 14 | SUGGESTION | skills/intent-router/SKILL.md | LOW confidence join formatting | Changed to newline separator | 1 |
| 15 | SUGGESTION | skills/intent-router/SKILL.md | Scoring cap not explicit in prose | Not fixed — code caps naturally at 1.0 | - |

## Reviewer Verdicts

| Reviewer | Cycle 1 | Key Observations |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| testing-reality-checker | NEEDS WORK | Found lifecycle detection logic bugs, missing keyword, step numbering issues. Rating: B+ |
| testing-workflow-optimizer | NEEDS WORK | Found process flow issues, substring matching, cross-command dead ends. 2 BLOCKERs on step numbering |

## Suggestions (not required)
- harden/security-only keyword overlap could cause unpredictable routing for some inputs
- Step 5 vs Step 5b in status.md could benefit from a clarifying note
- Scoring formula naturally caps at 1.0 but prose could be more explicit
