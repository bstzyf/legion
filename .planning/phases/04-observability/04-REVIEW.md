## Findings Detail

| # | Severity | File | Issue | Reviewer | Resolution |
|---|----------|------|-------|----------|------------|
| 1 | WARNING | tests/observability-summary.test.js:27-33 | Loose table header matching — individual words match anywhere in file | engineering-senior-developer | Accepted — inherent to markdown template testing |
| 2 | WARNING | tests/observability-summary.test.js:66-73 | Same loose-match issue for Phase Decision Summary headers | engineering-senior-developer | Accepted — inherent to markdown template testing |
| 3 | WARNING | tests/observability-summary.test.js:117-124 | Graceful degradation assertions test words independently | engineering-senior-developer | Accepted — tests catch feature removal |
| 4 | WARNING | tests/observability-cycle-delta.test.js:131-139 | Brittle exact count (==3) assertion, redundant with section-specific tests | engineering-senior-developer | Accepted — redundant but harmless |
| 5 | WARNING | 04-01-PLAN.md frontmatter | Plan verification command references "Score Breakdown" but implementation uses "Score Export" | testing-reality-checker | Accepted — plan file archived, implementation correct |
| 6 | SUGGESTION | skills/review-loop/SKILL.md | Step 1.5 and Cycle Comparison overlap — future consolidation candidate | testing-workflow-optimizer | Noted for future refactor |
| 7 | SUGGESTION | skills/wave-executor/SKILL.md | LLM-native re-derivation approach could use a worked example | testing-workflow-optimizer | Noted — add if clarity issues arise |
| 8 | SUGGESTION | tests/observability-summary.test.js | OBS-03 coverage is indirect | engineering-senior-developer | Accepted — adequate for markdown templates |
| 9 | SUGGESTION | tests/ (both files) | Inconsistent file-reading patterns between test files | engineering-senior-developer | Noted — minor style difference |
| 10 | SUGGESTION | skills/agent-registry/SKILL.md | Pre-existing: agent count says 52, CLAUDE.md says 53 | testing-reality-checker | Out of scope — Phase 12 item |

## Reviewer Verdicts

| Reviewer | Verdict | Key Observations |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| testing-reality-checker | PASS | All 4 ROADMAP success criteria met with evidence. Cross-file references consistent. 44/44 tests pass. |
| testing-workflow-optimizer | PASS | Score_export pipeline consistent across 3 files. Graceful degradation documented. Two-tier fingerprint well-defined. |
| engineering-senior-developer | PASS | Tests follow correct toolchain. Coverage adequate for all OBS requirements. Fingerprint test is model example. |

## Suggestions (Not Required)

- **Future refactor**: Consolidate review-loop Step 1.5 and Cycle Comparison into single substep
- **Clarity enhancement**: Add worked example for LLM-native score re-derivation in wave-executor
- **Test hardening**: Replace loose string matches with table-row regex patterns in test files
- **Pre-existing**: Resolve agent count inconsistency (52 vs 53) in Phase 12

## Success Criteria Verification

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | SUMMARY.md template includes "Agent Selection Rationale" section with recommendation scores | VERIFIED |
| 2 | REVIEW.md template includes "Cycle Delta" section showing what changed between review cycles | VERIFIED |
| 3 | Wave executor captures and writes structured decision data | VERIFIED |
| 4 | Tests verify decision log format and cycle diff output | VERIFIED (44 tests, all passing) |
