# Plan 08-02 Summary — Test Coverage Enrichment

## Status: Complete

**Agent**: testing-evidence-collector
**Wave**: 1
**Requirements**: MAP-02
**Date**: 2026-03-06

## What Was Done

1. **Section 9.4 added to SKILL.md** — Coverage Tool Integration (MAP-02) with 4 subsections:
   - 9.4.1: Coverage Report Detection (6 tools: nyc/istanbul, jest, pytest-cov, go test, SimpleCov, cargo-tarpaulin)
   - 9.4.2: Coverage Percentage Extraction (4 formats: JSON summary, LCOV, Cobertura XML, Go cover)
   - 9.4.3: Coverage Quality Classification (>=80% HIGH, 50-79% MEDIUM, <50% LOW)
   - 9.4.4: Graceful Degradation (falls back to sample-based ratio, never runs test suites)

2. **Section 9.5 added to SKILL.md** — Critical File Coverage Correlation (MAP-02) with 3 subsections:
   - 9.5.1: Critical File Identification (risk = fan_in_score * 10 + complexity_score / 100)
   - 9.5.2: Output (ranked top-5 table with File, Lines, Fan-in, Risk Score, Risk Level, Recommendation)
   - 9.5.3: Graceful Degradation (degrades per data source availability)

3. **CODEBASE.md template updated** — `## Test Coverage Map` enriched with `**Source**` field and `### Critical Untested Files` table. Graceful degradation placeholder preserved.

4. **Section 7.2 updated** — Re-Analysis Protocol Step 4 now includes Section 9.4 and Section 9.5.

5. **Tests appended** — 13 new tests in 2 describe blocks validating specification conformance and template structure.

## Files Modified
- skills/codebase-mapper/SKILL.md
- tests/codebase-mapper-enrichment.test.js

## Verification
- All 28 tests pass (15 MAP-01 + 13 MAP-02)
- All grep verification commands pass
- No regressions
