## Findings Detail

| # | Severity | File | Issue | Fix Applied | Cycle Fixed |
|---|----------|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | WARNING | SKILL.md | Section 9.3 format mismatched Section 5 template | Updated 9.3 to use `{pct}%` + `**Source**` field | 1 |
| 2 | WARNING | SKILL.md | `/dev/stdin` fails on Windows | Replaced with `readFileSync(0)` (cross-platform fd) | 1 |
| 3 | WARNING | SKILL.md | 4.6.4 references nonexistent `time` field in package-lock.json | Rewritten to use `npm view` registry query | 1 |
| 4 | WARNING | SKILL.md | Section 4.4 "Dependency Risk" naming overlap with 4.6 | Renamed 4.4 to "Config & Hygiene Checks" | 1 |
| 5 | WARNING | SKILL.md | Trailing comment block conflicts with structured template | Replaced with descriptive reference comment | 1 |
| 6 | WARNING | tests/ | Destructured imports vs dominant `test.describe()` pattern | Aligned with `const test = require('node:test')` | 1 |
| 7 | WARNING | tests/ | String-only tests, no structural markdown validation | Accepted — appropriate for spec conformance tests | 1 |
| 8 | WARNING | summaries | Plan summaries lack before-state documentation | Added `## Before State` sections to both summaries | 1 |
| 9 | SUGGESTION | tests/ | Graceful degradation tests use global `includes()` | Noted — not required |
| 10 | SUGGESTION | tests/ | 300-char substring window for column check is fragile | Noted — not required |
| 11 | SUGGESTION | fixtures/ | Fixture validates itself but isn't used for classification logic | Noted — not required |
| 12 | SUGGESTION | SKILL.md | Section 4.6.5 duplicates summary table from Section 5 | Noted — not required |
| 13 | SUGGESTION | tests/ | File header only mentions MAP-01, not MAP-02 | Fixed alongside import style update | 1 |
| 14 | SUGGESTION | tests/ | Graceful degradation covers 3/5 scenarios (MEDIUM confidence) | Deferred |

## Reviewer Verdicts

| Reviewer | Rubric Focus | Cycle 1 | Cycle 2 | Key Observation |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| testing-reality-checker | Production Readiness | PASS (3 warnings) | PASS | Windows compatibility and factual errors in spec fixed cleanly |
| testing-evidence-collector | Verification Completeness | PASS (2 warnings) | PASS | Before-state documentation added; string-inclusion approach accepted for spec tests |
| engineering-senior-developer | Code Architecture | PASS (3 warnings) | PASS | Naming overlap resolved; test conventions aligned |

## Suggestions (not required)

- Scope graceful degradation test assertions to section boundaries instead of global `includes()`
- Increase substring window or use regex for Critical Untested Files column check
- Add comment clarifying fixture serves as reference example, not functional input
- Consider consolidating duplicate summary tables between 4.6.5 and Section 5 template

## Pre-Existing Issue (out of scope)

- `tests/installer-smoke.test.js` checksum verification failure — pre-existing, not caused by phase 8 changes. Checksums need regeneration (tracked for Phase 12: Integration & Release).
