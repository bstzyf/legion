# Plan 08-01 Summary — Dependency Risk Assessment

## Status: Complete

**Agent**: engineering-senior-developer
**Wave**: 1
**Requirements**: MAP-01
**Date**: 2026-03-06

## What Was Done

1. **Section 4.6 added to SKILL.md** — Package-Level Dependency Risk (MAP-01) with 6 subsections:
   - 4.6.1: Ecosystem Detection (npm, pip, bundler, cargo, go)
   - 4.6.2: Outdated Package Detection (major/minor/patch categorization)
   - 4.6.3: Heavy Dependency Detection (transitive ratio thresholds)
   - 4.6.4: Unmaintained Package Heuristic (>2 year staleness)
   - 4.6.5: Dependency Risk Summary (consolidated table)
   - 4.6.6: Graceful Degradation (skip conditions per subsection)

2. **CODEBASE.md template updated** — New `## Dependency Risk` section with Outdated Packages table, Heavy Dependencies, Potentially Unmaintained, and Summary. Includes graceful degradation placeholder for missing ecosystems.

3. **Section 7.2 updated** — Re-Analysis Protocol Step 4 now includes Section 4.6.

4. **Tests created** — 15 tests across 3 describe blocks validating specification conformance, template structure, and calibration logic.

5. **Fixture created** — `tests/fixtures/codebase-mapper/sample-npm-outdated.json` with 5 sample packages.
