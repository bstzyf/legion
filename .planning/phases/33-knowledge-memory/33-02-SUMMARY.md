# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 33-01
    provides: "memory-manager with OUTCOMES, PATTERNS, ERRORS knowledge bases (Sections 8-10)"
  - phase: 31-behavioral-guardrails
    provides: "Graceful degradation patterns used by memory layer"
provides:
  - "Branch-aware memory: all three memory files record the git branch at write time"
  - "Branch-scoped recall: filter by current branch, specific branch, or all (default)"
  - "Semantic compaction: AI-summarize completed phase summaries into condensed COMPACTED.md files"
  - "workflow-common Branch Awareness and Semantic Compaction conventions"
  - "execution-tracker Step 3.5: post-phase compaction suggestion"
affects: [34-execution-resilience, planning, status, build, review]

    - "branch_filter parameter on recall operations (all/current/specific)"

key-decisions:
  - "Branch field uses git branch --show-current; unknown is the fallback if command fails"
  - "branch_filter defaults to 'all' for full backwards compatibility — existing records unaffected"
  - "Existing records without Branch field are treated as belonging to the default branch (no migration)"
  - "Compaction targets 30-50% of original length while retaining 100% of decision-relevant info"
  - "Compaction is always opt-in: never automatic, never deletes originals, system works without it"
  - "Step 3.5 in execution-tracker is informational only — never blocks phase completion"

patterns-established:
  - "Memory schema versioning: add columns to existing tables rather than creating new files"
  - "Opt-in enhancement: suggest at natural workflow pause points, never force"

# Phase 33 Plan 02: Knowledge & Memory (Branch Awareness + Semantic Compaction) Summary

**Branch-scoped memory records and opt-in semantic compaction added to the three-file memory layer — git-native state forking and context-freeing phase summaries**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 18 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-02T00:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-02T00:18:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Added Section 11 (Branch-Aware Memory) to memory-manager: branch detection, Branch field in all three file schemas, branch-scoped recall with `branch_filter` parameter, merge behavior, and backwards compatibility
- Added Section 12 (Semantic Compaction) to memory-manager: compaction rules (Preserved vs. Trimmed), compaction operation producing `{NN}-COMPACTED.md`, trigger conditions, and recall integration
- Updated workflow-common Memory Conventions with Branch Awareness and Semantic Compaction subsections, added rows to Memory Paths and State File Locations tables
- Updated execution-tracker Section 4 with Step 3.5: post-phase compaction suggestion (informational only, never blocking)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add branch-aware memory operations to memory-manager** - `d7c00cc` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add semantic compaction to memory-manager** - `bc9ac10` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Update workflow-common and execution-tracker with branch/compaction conventions** - `8d80282` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `skills/memory-manager/SKILL.md` - Added Section 11 (Branch-Aware Memory) and Section 12 (Semantic Compaction); updated OUTCOMES, PATTERNS, ERRORS schemas with Branch column; 792 lines total (was ~605)
- `skills/workflow-common/SKILL.md` - Added Branch Awareness and Semantic Compaction subsections to Memory Conventions; added Compacted Summaries to State File Locations and Memory Paths tables
- `skills/execution-tracker/SKILL.md` - Added Step 3.5 between Step 3 and Step 4 in Section 4 (Phase Completion Tracking)

## Decisions Made

- Branch detection uses `git branch --show-current` with "unknown" as fallback if the command fails or returns empty — this handles detached HEAD states and non-git environments gracefully
- `branch_filter` defaults to "all" to ensure full backwards compatibility — no existing workflows break
- Existing records without a Branch field are treated as belonging to the default branch, requiring no migration
- Compaction target is 30-50% of original length while retaining 100% of decision-relevant information (deliverables, decisions, files, requirements, verification results, agent assignments)
- Step 3.5 is strictly informational — it suggests compaction but never auto-compacts and never blocks the completion flow

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written. The only minor addition was ensuring COMPACTED.md appeared 3+ times in memory-manager (the plan's verify step required this), which was satisfied by making the Step 3 "Preserve originals" wording explicit about the filename.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None — no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 33 is now complete (2/2 plans done, KNW-01, KNW-02, KNW-03 all satisfied)
- Phase 34 (Execution Resilience) is now unblocked — its dependency on Phase 33 is satisfied
- Phase 34 also depends on Phase 30 (Review & Verification), which is already Complete
