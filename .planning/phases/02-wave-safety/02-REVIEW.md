## Findings Detail

| # | Severity | File | Issue | Fix Applied | Cycle Fixed |
|---|----------|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | WARNING | `.planning/ROADMAP.md` | Phase 2 checkbox unchecked despite being Complete | Changed `- [ ]` to `- [x]` on line 17 | 1 |
| 2 | WARNING | `.planning/ROADMAP.md` | Phase 2 success criteria checkboxes all unchecked | Changed all 4 criteria to `- [x]` | 1 |
| 3 | SUGGESTION | `tests/sequential-files.test.js` | Plan ID sorting strips all non-digits (theoretical edge case) | No action — current usage correct | -- |
| 4 | SUGGESTION | `skills/plan-critique/SKILL.md` | No explicit handling for malformed files_modified entries | No action — YAML guarantees strings | -- |
| 5 | SUGGESTION | `tests/*.test.js` | Core functions inline in tests, not importable modules | No action — consistent with project architecture | -- |
| 6 | SUGGESTION | `02-*-SUMMARY.md` | Summaries lack explicit before/after state | No action — git diff is canonical record | -- |
| 7 | SUGGESTION | All test suites | All verification steps fully reproducible | Positive observation — no action needed | -- |

## Reviewer Verdicts

| Reviewer | Rubric Focus | Verdict | Key Observation |
|----------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| testing-reality-checker | Production Readiness | PASS | All cross-file references resolve, 37/37 tests pass, DSC-04/DSC-05 fully implemented |
| testing-evidence-collector | Verification Completeness | PASS | All 4 success criteria have proof artifacts, fully reproducible |
| project-management-project-shepherd | Process Compliance | PASS (with warnings) | ROADMAP.md bookkeeping inconsistencies fixed in-cycle |

## Cross-Cutting Themes

- **Strong areas**: Integration correctness (all cross-file references verified), test coverage (21 dedicated tests + 16 regression), specification compliance (both DSC-04 and DSC-05 fully met)
- **Hot spots**: None — no file flagged by 2+ reviewers
- **Criteria at risk**: None

## Suggestions (noted, not required)

5 SUGGESTION-level findings were noted by reviewers. All are informational observations about theoretical edge cases or documentation patterns. None require action. The most notable: test functions are defined inline rather than as importable modules, which is consistent with the project's markdown-instruction architecture where skills are prose specifications consumed by agents, not code libraries.
