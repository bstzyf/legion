# Legion — Roadmap

## Milestones

- [x] **v1.0** — Core plugin with 9 commands, 15 skills, 51 agents, multi-domain workflows (14 phases, 30 plans, 54 requirements) → [Archive](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md)
- [x] **v2.0** — Proper Claude Code plugin with advisory capabilities: manifest, restructured directories, installable via `claude plugin add`, plus strategic advisors, dynamic review panels, and plan critique (9 phases, 9 plans, 26 requirements) → [Archive](milestones/v2.0-ROADMAP.md)
- [x] **v3.0** — Legion rebrand: `/legion:` namespace, plugin manifest, rewritten docs, attribution, and repo rename (5 phases, 6 plans, 13 requirements) → [Archive](milestones/v3.0-ROADMAP.md)
- [ ] **v4.0** — Inspiration audit adoption: progressive disclosure, review quality, behavioral guardrails, planning intelligence, knowledge layer, execution resilience (6 phases, 15 requirements)

## v4.0 — Inspiration Audit Adoption

**Goal:** Cherry-pick proven patterns from the best orchestration tools in the Claude Code ecosystem while maintaining Legion's core identity.

**Source:** [Inspiration Audit & Adoption Plan](../docs/plans/2026-03-02-inspiration-audit-and-adoption.md)

**Origins:** Conductor, Feature-dev, code-foundations, beads, Auto-Claude, bjarne, Puzld.ai

### Phase 29: Progressive Disclosure
**Goal:** Skills load as lightweight metadata at startup; full content injected only when activated — reducing context overhead from ~17,000 tokens to ~1,700 tokens at idle.
**Depends on:** Nothing (first v4.0 phase)
**Requirements:** PRG-01, PRG-02
**Success Criteria:**
1. All 17 SKILL.md files have valid YAML frontmatter with name, triggers, token_cost, and summary
2. `workflow-common` documents the Skill Loading Protocol with clear load-on-activate instructions
3. Each frontmatter summary is ≤100 tokens

### Phase 30: Review & Verification Quality
**Goal:** Reviews are confidence-filtered, tasks have machine-checkable verification, and review loops self-terminate when stuck.
**Depends on:** Nothing (parallel with Phase 29)
**Requirements:** REV-01, REV-02, REV-03
**Success Criteria:**
1. `review-loop` and `review-panel` contain explicit 80%+ confidence threshold with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW classification
2. `phase-decomposer` task template includes `> verification:` format with example commands
3. `wave-executor` checks verification commands after task execution and blocks completion on failure
4. `review-loop` aborts after 3 iterations with no delta, outputs remaining issues and recommendations

### Phase 31: Behavioral Guardrails
**Goal:** Agents and workflows have explicit boundaries that prevent rationalization and overreach.
**Depends on:** Nothing (parallel with Phases 29-30)
**Requirements:** DSC-01, DSC-02
**Success Criteria:**
1. `testing-reality-checker` has a "Common Rationalizations I Reject" table with ≥5 entries
2. `engineering-senior-developer` has a similar table focused on code quality rationalizations
3. `CLAUDE.md` authority matrix clearly separates autonomous decisions from human-approval decisions

### Phase 32: Planning Intelligence
**Goal:** `/legion:plan` produces competing architecture proposals and can optionally run a spec pipeline before coding.
**Depends on:** Phase 29 (skill metadata for new spec-pipeline skill)
**Requirements:** PLN-01, PLN-02
**Success Criteria:**
1. `plan` command spawns 2-3 agents with labeled philosophies (minimal, clean, pragmatic) and presents trade-offs
2. User can select an approach or request a hybrid before planning proceeds
3. Spec pipeline skill exists with 5 clear stages (gather, research, write, critique, assess) and can be invoked before `/legion:build`

### Phase 33: Knowledge & Memory
**Goal:** The memory layer captures structured patterns, supports branch-aware context, and compacts completed work.
**Depends on:** Phase 31 (authority matrix defines autonomous boundaries for memory operations)
**Requirements:** KNW-01, KNW-02, KNW-03
**Success Criteria:**
1. `memory-manager` reads/writes PATTERNS.md (successful patterns → reuse criteria) and ERRORS.md (error signatures → known fixes)
2. Templates for PATTERNS.md and ERRORS.md exist in `.planning/memory/`
3. Memory state can be associated with git branches — context forks when branches fork, merges when branches merge
4. Completed phase summaries are AI-compacted: full reasoning preserved, verbose details trimmed, context freed

### Phase 34: Execution Resilience & Learning
**Goal:** Execution is self-healing (auto-remediation), token-efficient (output redirection), and learns from user preferences (DPO).
**Depends on:** Phase 30 (verification points feed DPO quality signal), Phase 33 (knowledge base stores preference data)
**Requirements:** EXE-01, EXE-02, EXE-03
**Success Criteria:**
1. When a user accepts, rejects, or edits a proposed file change, the delta is stored as a preference pair in `.planning/memory/`
2. Missing dependencies detected during execution auto-generate remediation tasks (install, configure) instead of failing
3. Commands known to produce verbose output (`npm install`, `pip install`, build tools) redirect stdout to temp files, check exit codes, and only surface errors

## Phase Dependencies

Phase 29 (Progressive Disclosure) ──┐
                                     ├── Phase 32 (Planning Intelligence)

```

Phases 29, 30, 31 can execute in parallel (no dependencies).
Phase 32 depends on 29.
Phase 33 depends on 31.
Phase 34 depends on 30 + 33.
