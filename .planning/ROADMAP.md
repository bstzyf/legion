## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Plan Schema Hardening
**Goal**: Add `files_forbidden`, `expected_artifacts`, and mandatory `verification_commands` to the plan frontmatter schema, with plan-critique enforcement.
**Requirements**: DSC-01, DSC-02, DSC-03
**Recommended Agents**: engineering-senior-developer, testing-reality-checker, project-management-project-shepherd
**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Plan template includes `files_forbidden` and `expected_artifacts` fields
- [ ] Plan-critique skill flags plans missing `verification_commands` as BLOCKER
- [ ] Existing plan examples updated to demonstrate new fields
- [ ] Tests validate schema enforcement
**Plans**: 3

### Phase 2: Wave Safety
**Goal**: Add file overlap detection in plan-critique for same-wave plans and establish `sequential_files` convention in wave metadata.
**Requirements**: DSC-04, DSC-05
**Recommended Agents**: engineering-backend-architect, testing-evidence-collector, project-management-project-shepherd
**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Plan-critique detects when two plans in the same wave list overlapping `files_modified` and flags BLOCKER
- [x] Wave metadata supports `sequential_files` list for single-agent access files
- [x] Wave executor respects `sequential_files` during dispatch
- [x] Tests cover overlap detection and sequential_files enforcement
**Plans**: 2

### Phase 3: Control Modes
**Goal**: Add `control_mode` setting with `autonomous`/`guarded`/`advisory`/`surgical` presets that adjust which authority matrix rules are active.
**Requirements**: CTL-01, CTL-02, CTL-03
**Recommended Agents**: engineering-senior-developer, testing-reality-checker, design-ux-architect
**Success Criteria**:
- [x] `settings.json` schema includes `control_mode` with 4 preset values
- [x] Each preset maps to specific authority matrix rule adjustments (documented)
- [x] Settings schema docs updated with mode descriptions and examples
- [x] Tests validate mode-to-authority mapping
**Plans**: 3

### Phase 4: Observability
**Goal**: Add decision logging to SUMMARY.md and cycle-over-cycle diff to REVIEW.md for improved trust and debuggability.
**Requirements**: OBS-01, OBS-02, OBS-03
**Recommended Agents**: engineering-senior-developer, testing-evidence-collector
**Success Criteria**:
- [x] SUMMARY.md template includes "Agent Selection Rationale" section with recommendation scores
- [x] REVIEW.md template includes "Cycle Delta" section showing what changed between review cycles
- [x] Wave executor captures and writes structured decision data
- [x] Tests verify decision log format and cycle diff output
**Plans**: 2

### Phase 5: Agent Metadata Enrichment
**Goal**: Add structured metadata fields (`languages`, `frameworks`, `artifact_types`, `review_strengths`) to all 53 agent frontmatter files.
**Requirements**: AGT-01
**Recommended Agents**: agents-orchestrator, engineering-senior-developer, testing-reality-checker
**Success Criteria**:
- [x] All 53 agent .md files include `languages`, `frameworks`, `artifact_types`, `review_strengths` in frontmatter
- [x] Metadata is accurate to each agent's described capabilities (not generic)
- [x] Agent contract tests validate new required fields
- [x] No agent personality text is altered — frontmatter only
**Plans**: 3

### Phase 6: Recommendation Engine v2
**Goal**: Update recommendation engine to score against enriched metadata, add `task_type` to outcome records, and implement archetype-weighted recommendation boosts.
**Requirements**: AGT-02, AGT-03, AGT-04
**Recommended Agents**: engineering-backend-architect, testing-evidence-collector, data-analytics-reporter
**Success Criteria**:
- [x] `recommendation-engine.js` scores against `languages`, `frameworks`, `artifact_types` fields
- [x] OUTCOMES.md schema includes `task_type` field per outcome record
- [x] Recommendations weighted by archetype success rate from historical outcomes
- [x] Recommendation engine tests cover new scoring paths with >90% coverage
**Plans**: 3

### Phase 7: Validation & Conformance
**Goal**: Add adapter schema conformance tests, cross-reference validation, lint-commands, and new adapter spec fields.
**Requirements**: VAL-01, VAL-02, VAL-03, VAL-04
**Recommended Agents**: testing-reality-checker, engineering-senior-developer, testing-api-tester
**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Test suite validates all 9 adapters have required ADAPTER.md fields
- [ ] Cross-reference test verifies all command .md files reference existing skills and agents
- [ ] `lint-commands` test catches dead references and orphan tags
- [ ] ADAPTER.md spec includes `max_prompt_size` and `known_quirks` fields
- [ ] All 9 adapters updated with new fields
**Plans**: 3

### Phase 8: Codebase Mapper Enrichment
**Goal**: Enrich codebase-mapper skill output with dependency risk assessment and test coverage summary.
**Requirements**: MAP-01, MAP-02
**Recommended Agents**: engineering-senior-developer, testing-evidence-collector
**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Codebase-mapper produces "Dependency Risk" section in CODEBASE.md (outdated, unmaintained, heavy deps)
- [ ] Codebase-mapper produces "Test Coverage" section in CODEBASE.md (coverage percentage, untested areas)
- [ ] Both sections degrade gracefully when data unavailable
- [ ] Tests validate enriched output format
**Plans**: 2

### Phase 9: Polymath Advanced Modes
**Goal**: Add onboard, compare, and debate modes to the Polymath agent and `/legion:explore` workflow.
**Requirements**: POLY-07, POLY-08, POLY-09
**Recommended Agents**: agents-orchestrator, engineering-senior-developer, design-ux-architect, testing-reality-checker

- [ ] Onboard mode guides structured codebase familiarization with progressive depth
- [ ] Compare mode produces structured comparison matrix with decision capture
- [ ] Debate mode supports adversarial exploration with winner tracking (DPO-inspired)
- [ ] All modes enforce structured choices (no open-ended questions)

**Requirements**: AUTH-06, AUTH-07

**Recommended Agents**: engineering-ai-ml-engineer, engineering-senior-developer, testing-reality-checker
**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Intent router parses natural language queries to command+flags (e.g., "fix the tests" → `/legion:review`)
- [ ] Context-aware suggestions consider current STATE.md position when recommending actions
- [ ] Existing intent tests extended for natural language inputs
- [ ] Fallback to explicit command when confidence is low
**Plans**: 2

### Phase 12: Integration & Release
