# Phase 19: Registry Integration Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** The agent-registry skill correctly resolves all 51 agent paths under the new plugin structure, so agent lookup, recommendation, and team assembly work without modification after installation
**Verified:** 2026-03-02T06:15:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | All 51 registry entries have matching files on disk | VERIFIED | `grep -c 'agents/' SKILL.md` = 51; `ls agents/*.md` = 51; bidirectional cross-check: zero phantom entries, zero unregistered files |
| 2 | Every agent path in the registry resolves to an existing file | VERIFIED | Shell loop over all 51 registry-extracted paths — every `agents/{id}.md` exists on disk with content |
| 3 | Recommendation flow references correct paths | VERIFIED | All 7 commands declare `skills/agent-registry/SKILL.md` in `<execution_context>`; wave-executor and review-loop use `agents/{agent-id}.md` spawning pattern; Section 2 task-type index and Section 3 algorithm reference agents by ID that resolve to registered paths |
| 4 | All 51 agent files have valid frontmatter (name, description, division) | VERIFIED | Frontmatter loop: zero `NO NAME`, zero `NO DESCRIPTION`, zero `NO DIVISION` errors across all 51 files |
| 5 | State files reflect Phase 19 completion | VERIFIED | ROADMAP.md: Phase 19 marked `[x]` with `completed 2026-03-02`, `Plan 19-01` documented; REQUIREMENTS.md: `[x] **AGENT-04**` and traceability row `Complete`; STATE.md: `Phase 19 complete`, advanced to Phase 20 |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `commands/plan.md` | `skills/agent-registry/SKILL.md` | execution_context declaration | WIRED | grep confirmed present |
| `commands/build.md` | `skills/agent-registry/SKILL.md` | execution_context declaration | WIRED | grep confirmed present |
| `commands/quick.md` | `skills/agent-registry/SKILL.md` | execution_context declaration | WIRED | grep confirmed present |
| `commands/review.md` | `skills/agent-registry/SKILL.md` | execution_context declaration | WIRED | grep confirmed present |
| `commands/portfolio.md` | `skills/agent-registry/SKILL.md` | execution_context declaration | WIRED | grep confirmed present |
| `commands/agent.md` | `skills/agent-registry/SKILL.md` | execution_context declaration | WIRED | grep confirmed present |
| `commands/start.md` | `skills/agent-registry/SKILL.md` | execution_context declaration | WIRED | grep confirmed present |
| `skills/wave-executor/SKILL.md` | `agents/{agent-id}.md` | spawning path pattern | WIRED | Pattern found at 3 locations in file |
| `skills/review-loop/SKILL.md` | `agents/{agent-id}.md` | spawning path pattern | WIRED | Pattern found at 2 locations in file |
| `skills/agent-registry/SKILL.md` Section 1 | `agents/*.md` (all 51) | catalog path entries | WIRED | All 51 paths resolve to existing files; bidirectional cross-check clean |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| AGENT-04 | 19-01-PLAN.md | Agent registry skill updated to reference new plugin-relative paths | SATISFIED | Registry contains 51 entries all using `agents/{id}.md`; marked `[x]` in REQUIREMENTS.md; traceability row shows Complete |

**Orphaned requirements:** None. The only requirement mapped to Phase 19 in REQUIREMENTS.md is AGENT-04, which is claimed by plan 19-01 and verified above.

---

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `skills/agent-registry/SKILL.md` | 220 | "no placeholder" in prose | Info | Algorithmic documentation text — not a stub; context: "skip this step entirely, proceed to Step 5. No warning, no placeholder." |

No blocker or warning anti-patterns found. The one "placeholder" hit is algorithm documentation prose instructing agents NOT to show a placeholder, not an implementation stub.

---

### Human Verification Required

**None identified.** Phase 19 is a verification-and-state-update phase with no UI, no real-time behavior, and no external service integration. All success criteria are mechanically verifiable via file existence, grep patterns, and count checks — all of which passed programmatically.

The one aspect that cannot be fully verified without runtime execution is:

#### 1. Live agent recommendation end-to-end

**Test:** Run `/agency:plan 1` on a test project and observe whether agents are recommended by name and whether their referenced files exist at the resolved paths.
**Expected:** Plan output names agents (e.g., `engineering-senior-developer`) and the file `agents/engineering-senior-developer.md` is read without error.
**Why human:** Requires an active Claude Code session with the plugin loaded; cannot be verified by grep alone.

This is a runtime behavior concern, not a code gap. The static chain (registry entry -> file on disk -> frontmatter present) is fully verified.

---

### Gaps Summary

None. All 5 observable truths verified. All artifacts exist, are substantive, and are wired. AGENT-04 is the only requirement for this phase and is satisfied. No stale paths, no phantom registry entries, no unregistered files, no missing frontmatter fields.

The SUMMARY's claims are accurate: Phase 18 had already completed all path updates; Phase 19 was purely verification and state bookkeeping, and that bookkeeping has been confirmed in the actual files.

## Spot-Check Evidence

Three agents verified through the complete chain (registry entry -> file exists -> content present -> frontmatter valid):

| Agent | Registry | File | Content | name: | division: |
|-------|----------|------|---------|-------|-----------|
| engineering-senior-developer | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| testing-reality-checker | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| design-ui-designer | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
