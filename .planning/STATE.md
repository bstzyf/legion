# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Turn 52 isolated agent personalities into a functional AI legion — "My name is Legion, for we are many."

## Current Position

Milestone: v5.0 — Production-Grade Architecture
Status: **Ready to Build** — Requirements defined, roadmap created
Last activity: 2026-03-05 — Milestone v5.0 initialized (32 requirements, 5 phases)

Progress: [█         ] 12% (5 phases planned, 1 plan executed, 2 requirements delivered)

## Shipped Milestones

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Requirements | Shipped |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| v1.0 | 14 | 30 | 54 | 2026-03-01 |
| v2.0 | 9 | 9 | 26 | 2026-03-02 |
| v3.0 | 5 | 6 | 13 | 2026-03-02 |
| v4.0 | 7 | 13 | 18 | 2026-03-02 |

## What's Deployed

- 11 commands (`/legion:start`, `plan`, `build`, `review`, `status`, `quick`, `portfolio`, `milestone`, `agent`, `advise`, `explore`)
- 18 skills with progressive disclosure metadata (triggers, token_cost, summary in frontmatter)
- 53 agents across 9 divisions (including Polymath pre-flight alignment specialist)
- Plugin manifest at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — name: `legion`, version: `3.0.0`
- Repository: `https://github.com/9thLevelSoftware/legion`

## Next Steps

v5.0 milestone initialized with 32 requirements across 5 phases.

**Phase 36 — Polymath Integration:** 
- Plan 01 complete (Polymath agent + /legion:explore command)
- Plan 02 complete (Polymath engine skill + exploration summary template)

**Phase 36 — Polymath Integration: COMPLETE**
- All 3 plans complete (36-01, 36-02, 36-03)
- Requirements satisfied: POLY-01, POLY-02, POLY-03, POLY-04, POLY-05, POLY-06

**Next:** Phase 37 — select next phase from v5.0 roadmap

## Recent Activity

### Completed: Plan 37-02 — Wave Executor Authority Injection

- Updated `skills/agent-registry/CATALOG.md` — Registered Polymath in Specialized Division
- Status: ✓ Complete, 3 commits, all verification criteria passed

## Session Continuity

### Key Decisions (carried forward)

- Full personality injection for all agent spawns
- /legion: namespace for all commands (v3.0 rebrand)
- Plugin name: legion
- Minimal state: PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md
- Balanced cost: Opus planning, Sonnet execution
- Hybrid agent selection: recommend → confirm
- Wave-based execution with max 3 tasks per plan
- Plugin-relative paths: `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/` at root
- Three-layer read-only for advisory
- Dynamic review panels over fixed board of directors
- Pre-mortem + assumption hunting for plan critique
- Competing architecture proposals: opt-in, 3 philosophies (Minimal, Clean, Pragmatic)
- Spec pipeline: optional 5-stage pre-coding specification
- Polymath engine: research-first exploration with structured choice protocol
- Cherry-pick from 10 inspiration sources, don't wholesale adopt any
- Maintain Legion's core identity: personality-first, wave execution, human-readable state
- Anti-patterns documented as guardrails (no agent inflation, no 50-iteration loops, no full automation without checkpoints)
- Polymath structured choice: arrow keys + Enter, max 7 exchanges
- Gap detection taxonomy: 5 categories (technical, scope, constraint, dependency, risk)
- Exploration output: crystallized summary or explicit park decision
- Exploration integration: Optional Step 2 in /legion:start, default "Yes" but skippable
- Seamless transition: Crystallized summary pre-populates Stage 1 questioning
- Park preservation: Exploration output saved to `.planning/exploration-{timestamp}.md`
