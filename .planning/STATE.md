# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Turn 51 isolated agent personalities into a functional AI legion — "My name is Legion, for we are many."

## Current Position

Milestone: v3.0 — Legion Rebrand
Phase: 28 — Documentation
Plan: 28-01 + 28-02 COMPLETE
Status: Phase 28 fully executed — all 4 docs (README, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md) rebranded to Legion with correct msitarzewski attribution
Last activity: 2026-03-02 — Phase 28 plans 01+02 executed (4 files rebranded, attribution credits msitarzewski/agency-agents)

Progress: [##########] 100% (5/5 phases complete)

## What's Deployed

- 10 commands (`/legion:start`, `plan`, `build`, `review`, `status`, `quick`, `portfolio`, `milestone`, `agent`, `advise`)
- 17 skills (agent-registry, phase-decomposer, wave-executor, review-loop, review-panel, plan-critique, + 11 more)
- 51 agents across 9 divisions
- Plugin manifest at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Distribution: marketplace.json, README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING

## Session Continuity

### Key Decisions (carried forward)

- Full personality injection for all agent spawns
- /legion: namespace for all commands (v3.0 rebrand from /agency:)
- Plugin name: legion (renamed from agency-workflows)
- Minimal state: PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md
- Balanced cost: Opus planning, Sonnet execution
- Hybrid agent selection: recommend → confirm
- Wave-based execution with max 3 tasks per plan
- Plugin-relative paths: `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/` at root
- Three-layer read-only for advisory: allowed-tools + Explore subagent + prompt
- Dynamic review panels over fixed board of directors
- Pre-mortem + assumption hunting for plan critique

### v3.0 Decisions

- Single atomic Write used for namespace substitution — prevents partial state during 47-occurrence bulk replace
- workflow-common updated first — it is the shared constants layer all skills and commands read from
- Commands updated before docs — doc success criteria reference final command names
- Plugin manifest updated before docs — README install instructions depend on final plugin name
- Agent personality files excluded from rebrand — they contain zero "agency" references
- .planning/ archive files excluded — preserve history as-is
- Repository URL in plugin manifests retained as agency-agents — it is the real GitHub repo name, not a branding field
- Historical changelog entries (v1.0.0, v2.0.0) preserved exactly as-is — they document what actually happened at those versions; v3.0.0 entry documents the rename
- Legion quote ("My name is Legion, for we are many.") anchors the v3.0.0 changelog entry as the rebrand narrative
