# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Turn 51 isolated agent personalities into a functional AI legion — "My name is Legion, for we are many."

## Current Position

Milestone: v4.0 — Inspiration Audit Adoption
Status: Active — Phase 35 complete (all 3 plans executed, post-fix audit CLEAN)
Last activity: 2026-03-03 — Phase 35 Plan 02 complete (post-fix re-scan: all 9 findings RESOLVED, no new issues, 35-AUDIT.md produced)

Progress: [==========] 100% (7/7 phases complete — Phase 35 Consolidation Audit all plans done)

## v4.0 Phase Map

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Depends On | Status |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 29 | Progressive Disclosure | PRG-01, PRG-02 | — | **Complete** |
| 30 | Review & Verification | REV-01, REV-02, REV-03 | — | **Complete** |
| 31 | Behavioral Guardrails | DSC-01, DSC-02 | — | **Complete** |
| 32 | Planning Intelligence | PLN-01, PLN-02 | Phase 29 | **Complete** |
| 33 | Knowledge & Memory | KNW-01, KNW-02, KNW-03 | Phase 31 | **Complete** |
| 34 | Execution Resilience | EXE-01, EXE-02, EXE-03 | Phase 30, 33 | **Executed (pending review)** |
| 35 | Consolidation Audit | CON-01, CON-02, CON-03 | Phase 34 | **Complete** |

**Parallel wave 1:** Phases 29, 30, 31 (no dependencies — can execute simultaneously)
**Wave 2:** Phase 32 (needs 29), Phase 33 (needs 31)
**Wave 3:** Phase 34 (needs 30 + 33)
**Wave 4:** Phase 35 (needs 34 — full-scope consolidation audit)

## Shipped Milestones

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Requirements | Shipped |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| v1.0 | 14 | 30 | 54 | 2026-03-01 |
| v2.0 | 9 | 9 | 26 | 2026-03-02 |
| v3.0 | 5 | 6 | 13 | 2026-03-02 |

## What's Deployed

- 10 commands (`/legion:start`, `plan`, `build`, `review`, `status`, `quick`, `portfolio`, `milestone`, `agent`, `advise`)
- 18 skills with progressive disclosure metadata (triggers, token_cost, summary in frontmatter)
- 51 agents across 9 divisions
- Plugin manifest at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — name: `legion`, version: `3.0.0`
- Repository: `https://github.com/9thLevelSoftware/legion`

## Next Steps

Phase 35 Plans 01, 02, and 03 complete — all CON requirements (CON-01, CON-02, CON-03) covered.
35-AUDIT.md produced: all 9 findings RESOLVED, post-fix re-scan CLEAN, 1 cosmetic item deferred (engineering-senior-developer description).
v4.0 milestone is complete — all 7 phases executed. Run `/legion:milestone` to close and archive v4.0.

### Key Decisions Added (35-01)

- marketing-social-media-strategist is the strategy layer (WHERE to show up), platform specialists are execution (HOW to show up there) — preserves all 4 platform specialists without modification
- project-manager-senior scope is TASK-level within a plan; differentiation from project-shepherd (PHASE-level) and studio-operations made explicit in personality body
- testing-workflow-optimizer scope locked to testing/QA metrics only — any non-testing metric is explicitly out of scope to prevent recurrence of the misclassification
- Division field uses Title Case to match CLAUDE.md canonical list; agent-creator validation updated in same commit to prevent creating new agents with old lowercase-hyphenated values
- Boundary documentation for agents-orchestrator is a blockquote at the top of file body — visible at first glance during full personality injection
- review-loop/review-panel cross-reference added only in frontmatter summary; bodies already cross-reference each other in References sections

### Key Decisions Added (35-02)

- Post-fix re-scan result: CLEAN — all 9 findings resolved, no new functional overlap or misclassification issues found
- engineering-senior-developer description has legacy technology references (Laravel/Livewire/FluxUI) — cosmetic issue, not an overlap defect; deferred to Phase 36
- All 18 skills are referenced in at least one command's execution_context — no orphaned skills exist
- Agent Inventory by Division confirms all 51 agents have unique primary capabilities after Phase 35 fixes

### Key Decisions Added (35-03)

- Agent Team Conventions placed in workflow-common as the shared hub — the correct single source since all commands reference workflow-common
- Claude Code memory is read-only from Legion's perspective — Legion reads it as a soft signal for agent selection but MUST NOT write to it (different audience: platform vs agent routing)
- Division Constants normalized to Title Case (Engineering, Design, Project Management, Spatial Computing) to match agent frontmatter division values
- memory-manager Section 14 and workflow-common Memory Conventions work as a pair — neither is authoritative alone; cross-reference in each

### Key Decisions Added (34-02)

- PREFERENCES.md is the fourth memory file with identical graceful degradation contract as OUTCOMES/PATTERNS/ERRORS
- Preference signals are soft: never exclude an agent solely based on negative preferences (situational context matters)
- Routing improvement formula: preference_boost = (sum of preference scores) * 0.5, added to base recommendation score from agent-registry
- Manual edit detection at both build completion (Step 5.a2) and review start (Step 2.5) for maximum coverage
- D-{NNN} ID format distinguishes preference records from O/P/E records in other memory files
- "NOT for routine decisions" rule documented explicitly: low-signal decisions like "Execute all plans" are excluded

### Key Decisions Added (34-01)

- BLOCKER vs ENVIRONMENT classification is the core decision gate for auto-remediation — environment errors auto-fix, business logic errors always escalate
- Max 1 remediation attempt per unique error prevents infinite retry loops
- Auto-remediation scope is bounded by the CLAUDE.md authority matrix (declared deps, expected dirs only)
- Output redirection never applies to test runners, linting, or type-checkers — those outputs are always informative
- Execution Resilience content is identical in both personality and autonomous agent prompts

### Key Decisions Added (33-02)

- Branch detection uses `git branch --show-current` with "unknown" fallback for detached HEAD / non-git environments
- branch_filter defaults to "all" for full backwards compatibility — no existing workflows break
- Existing records without Branch field treated as default branch — no migration required
- Compaction target: 30-50% of original length, 100% decision-relevant information preserved
- Compaction is always opt-in: never automatic, never deletes originals
- execution-tracker Step 3.5 is informational only — never blocks phase completion

### Key Decisions Added (33-01)

- PATTERNS.md uses Source field (O-{NNN}) linking to OUTCOMES.md for traceability
- ERRORS.md includes duplicate detection — skip if already resolved, update if previously unverified
- No importance weight for patterns; recency-only scoring (all stored patterns are inherently high-value)
- Identical graceful degradation contract for all three memory files

## Session Continuity

### Key Decisions (carried forward)

- Full personality injection for all agent spawns
- /legion: namespace for all commands (v3.0 rebrand)
- Plugin name: legion
- Minimal state: PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md
- Balanced cost: Opus planning, Sonnet execution
- Hybrid agent selection: recommend → confirm
- Wave-based execution with max 3 tasks per plan
- Plugin-relative paths: `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/` at root
- Three-layer read-only for advisory
- Dynamic review panels over fixed board of directors
- Pre-mortem + assumption hunting for plan critique
- Competing architecture proposals: opt-in, 3 philosophies (Minimal, Clean, Pragmatic)
- Spec pipeline: optional 5-stage pre-coding specification

### v4.0 Design Decisions

- Cherry-pick from 10 inspiration sources, don't wholesale adopt any
- Maintain Legion's core identity: personality-first, wave execution, human-readable state
- Anti-patterns documented as guardrails (no agent inflation, no 50-iteration loops, no full automation without checkpoints)
