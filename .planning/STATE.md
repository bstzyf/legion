# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Turn 51 isolated agent personalities into a functional AI legion — "My name is Legion, for we are many."

## Current Position

Milestone: v4.0 — Inspiration Audit Adoption
Status: Active — 5/6 phases complete, Phase 34 pending
Last activity: 2026-03-02 — Plan 33-02 complete: branch-aware memory and semantic compaction added to memory layer (KNW-02, KNW-03)

Progress: [========..] 83% (5/6 phases complete)

## v4.0 Phase Map

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Depends On | Status |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 29 | Progressive Disclosure | PRG-01, PRG-02 | — | **Complete** |
| 30 | Review & Verification | REV-01, REV-02, REV-03 | — | **Complete** |
| 31 | Behavioral Guardrails | DSC-01, DSC-02 | — | **Complete** |
| 32 | Planning Intelligence | PLN-01, PLN-02 | Phase 29 | **Complete** |
| 33 | Knowledge & Memory | KNW-01, KNW-02, KNW-03 | Phase 31 | **Complete** |
| 34 | Execution Resilience | EXE-01, EXE-02, EXE-03 | Phase 30, 33 | Pending |

**Parallel wave 1:** Phases 29, 30, 31 (no dependencies — can execute simultaneously)
**Wave 2:** Phase 32 (needs 29), Phase 33 (needs 31)
**Wave 3:** Phase 34 (needs 30 + 33)

## Shipped Milestones

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Requirements | Shipped |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| v1.0 | 14 | 30 | 54 | 2026-03-01 |
| v2.0 | 9 | 9 | 26 | 2026-03-02 |
| v3.0 | 5 | 6 | 13 | 2026-03-02 |

## What's Deployed

- 10 commands (`/legion:start`, `plan`, `build`, `review`, `status`, `quick`, `portfolio`, `milestone`, `agent`, `advise`)
- 18 skills with progressive disclosure metadata (triggers, token_cost, summary in frontmatter)
- 51 agents across 9 divisions
- Plugin manifest at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — name: `legion`, version: `3.0.0`
- Repository: `https://github.com/9thLevelSoftware/legion`

## Next Steps

Phase 33 complete — all 3 plans done (KNW-01, KNW-02, KNW-03 satisfied). 5/6 phases complete.
Phase 34 (Execution Resilience) is now unblocked — both dependencies satisfied (Phase 30 done, Phase 33 done).
Run `/legion:plan 34` to plan Phase 34 with EXE-01, EXE-02, EXE-03 requirements.

### Key Decisions Added (33-02)

- Branch detection uses `git branch --show-current` with "unknown" fallback for detached HEAD / non-git environments
- branch_filter defaults to "all" for full backwards compatibility — no existing workflows break
- Existing records without Branch field treated as default branch — no migration required
- Compaction target: 30-50% of original length, 100% decision-relevant information preserved
- Compaction is always opt-in: never automatic, never deletes originals
- execution-tracker Step 3.5 is informational only — never blocks phase completion

### Key Decisions Added (33-01)

- PATTERNS.md uses Source field (O-{NNN}) linking to OUTCOMES.md for traceability
- ERRORS.md includes duplicate detection — skip if already resolved, update if previously unverified
- No importance weight for patterns; recency-only scoring (all stored patterns are inherently high-value)
- Identical graceful degradation contract for all three memory files

## Session Continuity

### Key Decisions (carried forward)

- Full personality injection for all agent spawns
- /legion: namespace for all commands (v3.0 rebrand)
- Plugin name: legion
- Minimal state: PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md
- Balanced cost: Opus planning, Sonnet execution
- Hybrid agent selection: recommend → confirm
- Wave-based execution with max 3 tasks per plan
- Plugin-relative paths: `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/` at root
- Three-layer read-only for advisory
- Dynamic review panels over fixed board of directors
- Pre-mortem + assumption hunting for plan critique
- Competing architecture proposals: opt-in, 3 philosophies (Minimal, Clean, Pragmatic)
- Spec pipeline: optional 5-stage pre-coding specification

### v4.0 Design Decisions

- Cherry-pick from 10 inspiration sources, don't wholesale adopt any
- Maintain Legion's core identity: personality-first, wave execution, human-readable state
- Anti-patterns documented as guardrails (no agent inflation, no 50-iteration loops, no full automation without checkpoints)
