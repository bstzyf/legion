# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Turn 51 isolated agent personalities into a functional AI agency, packaged as a proper Claude Code plugin installable via `claude plugin add`
**Current Focus:** v2.0 Proper Plugin — convert Agency from `.claude/` config into distributable plugin with advisory capabilities (strategic advisors, dynamic review panels, plan critique)

## Current Position

Phase: 20 (Distribution) — Not started
Plan: 20-01 (not started)
Status: Phase 19 complete — registry verified, all 51 agent paths confirmed, AGENT-04 satisfied
Last activity: 2026-03-02 — Phase 19 execution complete

## Progress (v2.0)

```
[###############               ]  56% — 5/9 phases complete

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (v2.0)

- Templates co-located at `skills/questioning-flow/templates/` — plugin assets belong with the plugin, not project-level `.planning/` (Phase 17)
- `.planning/templates/` removed in Phase 18 — commands now reference `skills/questioning-flow/templates/`
- All skill and command path updates complete — zero stale `.claude/` or `agency-agents/` references remain (Phase 18)
- `.claude/commands/` removed (empty after migration) — `.claude/` directory now contains no project files
- Plugin manifest goes in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — standard Claude Code plugin location
- `settings.json` at plugin root alongside manifest phase (Phase 15)
- Agent migration (Phase 16) and skill migration (Phase 17) are independent — can proceed in parallel
- Command migration (Phase 18) depends on agents and skills being in place first
- Registry update (Phase 19) depends on agent paths being settled (Phase 16) and commands updated (Phase 18)
- Distribution artifacts (Phase 20) are last — depends on full functional plugin
- Strategic advisors (Phase 21) use dynamic agent selection, not fixed roles — leverages existing agent-registry
- Dynamic review panels (Phase 22) compose 2-4 reviewers with domain-weighted rubrics — replaces Conductor's fixed 5-director board
- Plan critique (Phase 23) uses pre-mortem inversion and assumption hunting — cherry-picked from Conductor's plan-critiquer

### Key Decisions (v1.0, inherited)

- Full personality injection for all agent spawns
- /agency: namespace for all commands
- Minimal state: PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md
- Balanced cost: Opus planning, Sonnet execution
- Hybrid agent selection: recommend → confirm
- Wave-based execution with max 3 tasks per plan
- Memory stored at .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md — graceful degradation
- GitHub operations all use graceful degradation
- Marketing/design detection uses three-signal OR heuristic

## Session Continuity

### To Resume Work

1. Read `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase structure and requirements
2. Check which phase is "Not started" in the Progress table above
3. Run `/gsd:plan-phase {N}` for the next unstarted phase
4. After planning, run `/gsd:build` to execute

### Next Steps

Phase 19 complete. Run `/gsd:plan-phase 20` to plan the Distribution phase.
Phase 20 covers marketplace entry, README, CHANGELOG, and developer testing docs (DIST-01 through DIST-04).
