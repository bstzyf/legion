# Project State

## Current Position
- **Phase**: 5 of 6 (executed, pending review)
- **Status**: Phase 5 complete — all plans executed successfully
- **Last Activity**: Phase 5 execution (2026-03-01)

## Progress
```
[##############......] 73% — 11/15 plans complete
```

## Phase 1 Results
- Plan 01-01 (Wave 1): Plugin skeleton — 6 commands, workflow-common skill, CLAUDE.md
- Plan 01-02 (Wave 2): Agent registry (278 lines, 51 agents), 3 templates, README

## Phase 2 Results
- Plan 02-01 (Wave 1): Questioning flow skill (255 lines) — 3-stage adaptive conversation engine with output mapping
- Plan 02-02 (Wave 2): Full /agency:start implementation (103 lines) — 9-step process wiring skills + templates

## Phase 3 Results
- Plan 03-01 (Wave 1): Phase-decomposer skill (503 lines) — 8-section decomposition engine with plan file template and agent recommendation
- Plan 03-02 (Wave 2): Full /agency:plan implementation (10-step process) — wires all 3 skills with auto-detect and confirmation gates

## Phase 4 Results
- Plan 04-01 (Wave 1): Wave-executor skill (475 lines) — parallel execution engine with personality injection and 8 error scenarios
- Plan 04-02 (Wave 1): Execution-tracker skill (240 lines) — progress tracking with STATE.md updates, ROADMAP.md progress, atomic git commits
- Plan 04-03 (Wave 2): Full /agency:build implementation (228 lines) — 6-step process wiring wave-executor + execution-tracker with confirmation gate

## Phase 5 Results
- Plan 05-01 (Wave 1): Review-loop skill (685 lines) — 9-section dev-QA loop engine with structured feedback, fix routing, and escalation
- Plan 05-02 (Wave 2): Full /agency:review implementation (315 lines) — 6-step process wiring review-loop + execution-tracker with agent selection, 3-cycle loop, and escalation

## Recent Decisions
- Plugin format: Claude Code .claude/ directory structure
- Full personality injection for all agent spawns
- /agency: namespace for all commands
- Minimal state: PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md
- Balanced cost: Opus planning, Sonnet execution
- Hybrid agent selection: recommend → confirm
- Adaptive questioning: vision-first, 3-stage flow, 5-8 exchanges target
- Template-driven generation: skills produce data, templates define structure
- Two-skill split for execution: wave-executor (spawning/coordination) + execution-tracker (progress/commits)
- Parallel dispatch via Claude Code Teams (TeamCreate + team_name + SendMessage) — preserves coordinator context

## Pre-existing Issues
- 2 spatial-computing agents lack YAML frontmatter (terminal-integration-specialist, visionos-spatial-engineer)

## Next Action
Run `/agency:review` to verify Phase 5: Quality Gates
