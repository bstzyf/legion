## Recent Decisions
- Plugin format: Claude Code .claude/ directory structure
- Full personality injection for all agent spawns
- /agency: namespace for all commands
- Minimal state: PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md
- Balanced cost: Opus planning, Sonnet execution
- Hybrid agent selection: recommend → confirm
- Adaptive questioning: vision-first, 3-stage flow, 5-8 exchanges target
- Template-driven generation: skills produce data, templates define structure
- Two-skill split for execution: wave-executor (spawning/coordination) + execution-tracker (progress/commits)
- Parallel dispatch via Claude Code Teams (TeamCreate + team_name + SendMessage) — preserves coordinator context
- Global portfolio registry at ~/.claude/agency/portfolio.md — outside project directories
- /agency:portfolio as separate command from /agency:status — single-responsibility
- Read-time state aggregation — no background sync, always fresh
- Studio Producer analysis is opt-in on demand (Opus cost)
- Milestones placed between Phase Details and Progress in ROADMAP.md
- Plan percentage as primary milestone metric (finer than phase count)
- 10-char milestone progress bar (vs 20-char project bar)
- Milestone command follows portfolio.md structure with 7-step action loop
- Status milestone section conditional — omitted when milestones not defined
- Milestone boundary routing (e2) takes priority over generic next-phase routing
- Memory stored as single markdown table at .planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md — consistent with all Agency state
- Decay computed at recall time (1.0/0.7/0.4/0.1 by age bracket), never destructively applied
- Memory boosts supplement but never override agent-registry recommendation algorithm
- All memory integration guarded by file existence checks — graceful degradation
- Custom agents project-scoped in agency-agents/{division}/ — consistent with built-in agents
- /agency:agent as single-word command — consistent with existing command naming convention
- Custom Division table in agent-registry.md — custom agents auto-eligible for recommendation algorithm

## Phase 10 Results
- Plan 10-01 (Wave 1): Agent-creator skill (411 lines) — 7-section guided creation engine with schema validation, file generation, registry update + workflow-common custom division support
- Plan 10-02 (Wave 2): Full /agency:agent command (119 lines) — 8-step process wiring agent-creator + agent-registry + workflow-common with git commit + CLAUDE.md/REQUIREMENTS.md updates

## Phase 11 Results
- Plan 11-01 (Wave 1): github-sync skill (678 lines) — 8-section GitHub operations engine with prerequisites, issue management, PR creation, milestone sync, status readback, state linking, error handling, graceful degradation + workflow-common GitHub Conventions section
- Plan 11-02 (Wave 2): GitHub integration wired into 5 commands (plan, build, status, review, milestone) + execution-tracker PR convention + CLAUDE.md/REQUIREMENTS.md updates

## Phase 12 Results
- Plan 12-01 (Wave 1): Codebase-mapper skill (622 lines) — 6-section brownfield analysis engine with source detection, language analysis, framework detection, risk assessment, CODEBASE.md output format, and integration patterns
- Plan 12-02 (Wave 2): Workflow integration — start.md brownfield detection branch (step 2, 3 user options), plan.md CODEBASE.md context injection (Risk Areas, Agent Guidance, Conventions, Detected Stack) + CLAUDE.md/REQUIREMENTS.md updates

- /agency:agent as single-word command — consistent with existing command naming convention
- Custom Division table in agent-registry.md — custom agents auto-eligible for recommendation algorithm
- One issue per phase, one PR per phase — phases are the meaningful tracking unit
- Issue creation automatic (plan.md), PR creation confirmable (build.md) — low-risk vs high-risk
- STATE.md ## GitHub section stores linking metadata — centralized, not scattered in plan frontmatters
- Live status queries for dashboard — never rely on stale STATE.md values for GitHub status
- "agency" label auto-created on first issue — no setup required
- Branch management: offer agency/phase-{NN}-{slug} if on default branch, respect existing feature branches
- All GitHub operations use graceful degradation — identical to Memory Conventions pattern
- Brownfield detection is opt-in via AskUserQuestion — never forced, consistent with Agency's guided workflow pattern
- All brownfield operations use graceful degradation — skip silently when CODEBASE.md is absent
- Stale CODEBASE.md (>30 days) warns but does not block — user decides when to re-analyze
- Marketing detection uses three-signal OR heuristic (MKT-* requirements, keywords, agent signals)
- Marketing wave pattern (Strategy, Creation, Distribution) replaces generic decomposition for marketing phases
- Team assembly replaces per-plan agent recommendation for marketing phases
- All marketing integration uses graceful degradation — skip silently for non-marketing phases
- Campaign documents generated at .planning/campaigns/{campaign-slug}.md during planning

## Phase 13 Results
- Plan 13-01 (Wave 1): Marketing-workflows skill (538 lines) — 6-section marketing campaign engine with channel-agent mapping, campaign planning, content calendar, cross-channel coordination, adaptation guidelines + workflow-common Marketing Workflow Conventions
- Plan 13-02 (Wave 2): Marketing command integration — phase-decomposer.md domain detection + wave patterns + team assembly, plan.md marketing-workflows reference + MARKETING PHASE DETECTION step + CLAUDE.md/REQUIREMENTS.md updates

## Phase 14 Results
- Plan 14-01 (Wave 1): Design-workflows skill (706 lines) — 6-section design workflow engine with domain detection, design system creation (DSN-01), UX research workflow (DSN-02), three-lens design review (DSN-03), design document formats, integration patterns + workflow-common Design Workflow Conventions
- Plan 14-02 (Wave 2): Design command integration — phase-decomposer.md design domain detection + design wave patterns + design team assembly, plan.md design-workflows reference + DESIGN PHASE DETECTION step, review.md three-lens DESIGN REVIEW ENHANCEMENT + CLAUDE.md/REQUIREMENTS.md updates

## Recent Decisions
- Design detection uses three-signal OR heuristic (DSN-* requirements, design keywords, agent signals) — mirrors marketing detection exactly
- Design wave pattern (Research & Foundation, Design System & Creation, Polish & Validation) replaces generic decomposition for design phases
- Team assembly replaces per-plan agent recommendation for design phases
- All design integration uses graceful degradation — skip silently for non-design phases
- Design documents generated at .planning/designs/{project-slug}-system.md during planning
- Three-lens design review (brand, accessibility, usability) replaces single-reviewer design review
- No new command — design workflows integrate into existing /agency:plan, /agency:build, /agency:review

## Verification Status
13 of 13 previously completed phases verified with UAT reports:
- Phases 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 — Verified 2026-03-01 (batch UAT)
- Phases 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 — Verified previously
- Phase 13 — Verified 2026-03-01 (6/6 passed, 0 issues)

## Next Action
All 14 phases complete (30/30 plans). Run `/gsd:verify-work` to validate Phase 14, then `/gsd:complete-milestone` to wrap up Milestone 1.
