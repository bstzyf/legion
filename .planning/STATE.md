# Project State

## Current Position
- **Phase**: 8 of 14 (complete)
- **Status**: Phase 8 complete — 2 plans, 2 waves
- **Last Activity**: Phase 8 Plan 08-02 execution (2026-03-01)

## Progress
```
[#################...] 86% — 19/22 plans complete
```

## Phase 1 Results
- Plan 01-01 (Wave 1): Plugin skeleton — 6 commands, workflow-common skill, CLAUDE.md
- Plan 01-02 (Wave 2): Agent registry (278 lines, 51 agents), 3 templates, README

## Phase 2 Results
- Plan 02-01 (Wave 1): Questioning flow skill (255 lines) — 3-stage adaptive conversation engine with output mapping
- Plan 02-02 (Wave 2): Full /agency:start implementation (103 lines) — 9-step process wiring skills + templates

## Phase 3 Results
- Plan 03-01 (Wave 1): Phase-decomposer skill (503 lines) — 8-section decomposition engine with plan file template and agent recommendation
- Plan 03-02 (Wave 2): Full /agency:plan implementation (10-step process) — wires all 3 skills with auto-detect and confirmation gates

## Phase 4 Results
- Plan 04-01 (Wave 1): Wave-executor skill (475 lines) — parallel execution engine with personality injection and 8 error scenarios
- Plan 04-02 (Wave 1): Execution-tracker skill (240 lines) — progress tracking with STATE.md updates, ROADMAP.md progress, atomic git commits
- Plan 04-03 (Wave 2): Full /agency:build implementation (228 lines) — 6-step process wiring wave-executor + execution-tracker with confirmation gate

## Phase 5 Results
- Plan 05-01 (Wave 1): Review-loop skill (685 lines) — 9-section dev-QA loop engine with structured feedback, fix routing, and escalation
- Plan 05-02 (Wave 2): Full /agency:review implementation (315 lines) — 6-step process wiring review-loop + execution-tracker with agent selection, 3-cycle loop, and escalation

## Phase 7 Results
- Plan 07-01 (Wave 1): Portfolio-manager skill (328 lines) — 6-section registry, CRUD, state aggregation, dependencies, agent allocation + workflow-common and start.md updates
- Plan 07-02 (Wave 2): Full /agency:portfolio implementation (245 lines) — 8-step dashboard with health indicators, dependency tracking, Studio Producer integration, manual registration

## Phase 8 Results
- Plan 08-01 (Wave 1): Milestone-tracker skill (434 lines) — 6-section milestone management with format, definition, completion, archiving, metrics, error handling + workflow-common and execution-tracker updates
- Plan 08-02 (Wave 2): Full /agency:milestone command (241 lines) — 7-step lifecycle process + status.md milestone integration + MILE-01/02 complete

## Recent Decisions
- Plugin format: Claude Code .claude/ directory structure
- Full personality injection for all agent spawns
- /agency: namespace for all commands
- Minimal state: PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md + STATE.md
- Balanced cost: Opus planning, Sonnet execution
- Hybrid agent selection: recommend → confirm
- Adaptive questioning: vision-first, 3-stage flow, 5-8 exchanges target
- Template-driven generation: skills produce data, templates define structure
- Two-skill split for execution: wave-executor (spawning/coordination) + execution-tracker (progress/commits)
- Parallel dispatch via Claude Code Teams (TeamCreate + team_name + SendMessage) — preserves coordinator context
- Global portfolio registry at ~/.claude/agency/portfolio.md — outside project directories
- /agency:portfolio as separate command from /agency:status — single-responsibility
- Read-time state aggregation — no background sync, always fresh
- Studio Producer analysis is opt-in on demand (Opus cost)
- Milestones placed between Phase Details and Progress in ROADMAP.md
- Plan percentage as primary milestone metric (finer than phase count)
- 10-char milestone progress bar (vs 20-char project bar)
- Milestone command follows portfolio.md structure with 7-step action loop
- Status milestone section conditional — omitted when milestones not defined
- Milestone boundary routing (e2) takes priority over generic next-phase routing

## Phase 6 Results
- Plan 06-01 (Wave 1): Full /agency:status implementation (134 lines) — 6-step dashboard with progress bar, phase history, session resume, deterministic next-action routing
- Plan 06-02 (Wave 1): Full /agency:quick implementation (182 lines) — 7-step ad-hoc task execution with agent selection, personality injection, optional commit

## Pre-existing Issues
- ~~2 spatial-computing agents lack YAML frontmatter~~ — Fixed (2026-03-01)
- ~~INFRA-01 through INFRA-05 unchecked in REQUIREMENTS.md~~ — Fixed (2026-03-01)
- ~~build.md missing AskUserQuestion in allowed-tools~~ — Fixed (2026-03-01)
- ~~status.md missing execution-tracker in execution_context~~ — Fixed (2026-03-01)

## Next Action
Run `/agency:plan 9` to plan Phase 9: Cross-Session Learning.
