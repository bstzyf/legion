# Legion

Orchestrate 51 AI specialist personalities across 9 AI CLI runtimes.

> *"My name is Legion, for we are many."*

## What It Does

Turn 51 isolated agent personalities into a coordinated legion. Type `/legion:start`, describe what you want, and the system assembles the right team, plans the work, executes in parallel, and runs quality checks — with each agent operating in full character.

## Installation

### Quick install (recommended)

```bash
npx @9thlevelsoftware/legion --claude
```

Replace `--claude` with your runtime of choice:

### Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/9thLevelSoftware/legion.git
node bin/install.js --claude
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- One of the 9 AI CLI runtimes listed above (support tier varies by runtime)

## Getting Started

1. Install Legion (see above)
2. In any project directory, run `/legion:start`
3. Answer the guided questions — the system explores your vision before jumping to implementation
4. Review the generated PROJECT.md and ROADMAP.md
5. Run `/legion:plan 1` to plan the first phase with agent recommendations
6. Run `/legion:build` to execute with parallel agent teams
7. Run `/legion:review` for quality review
8. Repeat `/legion:plan N` → `/legion:build` → `/legion:review` for each phase

## Commands

| Command | Description | Usage |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `/legion:start` | Initialize project with guided questioning | Run once at project start |
| `/legion:plan <N>` | Plan phase N with agent recommendations and wave-structured tasks | After start, or after completing a phase |
| `/legion:build` | Execute current phase with parallel agent teams | After planning a phase |
| `/legion:review` | Run QA review cycle with testing/QA agents | After building a phase |
| `/legion:status` | Show progress dashboard and route to next action | Anytime — routes you to the right command |
| `/legion:quick <task>` | Run ad-hoc task with intelligent agent selection | Anytime — for one-off tasks |
| `/legion:advise <topic>` | Get read-only expert consultation from any agent | Anytime — standalone advisory, no phase context needed |
| `/legion:portfolio` | Multi-project dashboard with dependency tracking | When managing multiple projects |
| `/legion:milestone` | Milestone completion, archiving, and metrics | At project milestones |
| `/legion:agent` | Create a new agent personality through guided workflow | When you need a specialist that doesn't exist |
| `/legion:update` | Check for updates and install latest version from npm | After installation — keeps Legion current |

## How It Works

```
/legion:start            Guided questioning → PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md
       ↓
/legion:plan 1           Phase decomposition → Wave-structured plans + agent teams
       ↓                       ↓ (optional)
       ↓                 Plan critique → Pre-mortem + assumption hunting
       ↓
/legion:build            Parallel execution → Agents work in character, wave by wave
       ↓
/legion:review           Quality gate → Review → Fix → Re-review (default max 3 cycles, configurable)
       ↓                       ↓ (optional)
       ↓                 Panel mode → 2-4 domain-weighted reviewers with rubrics
       ↓
/legion:plan 2 → ...     Repeat for each phase until project complete


/legion:advise <topic>   Standalone → Read-only expert consultation (any time)
/legion:quick <task>     Standalone → One-off task with agent selection (any time)
```

## Workflows

### Core Workflow: start → plan → build → review

The main loop for any project. Run through these four commands in order, repeating plan → build → review for each phase.

#### `/legion:start` — Project Initialization

Guides you through an adaptive conversation (5-8 exchanges) to capture project vision, requirements, and constraints before generating any plans.

**Key steps:**
1. Pre-flight check — detects existing projects and offers to reinitialize or continue
2. Brownfield detection — if an existing codebase is found, offers architecture analysis via the `codebase-mapper` skill, producing `.planning/CODEBASE.md` with framework detection, risk areas, and conventions
3. Vision exploration — 3-stage adaptive conversation via `questioning-flow`: vision → requirements → constraints, targeting 5-8 natural exchanges
4. Agent recommendation — `agent-registry` scores all 51 agents to recommend 2-4 per phase based on keyword match and division affinity
5. Document generation — produces `PROJECT.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `STATE.md` using questioning-flow templates
6. Portfolio registration — registers the project in the global portfolio via `portfolio-manager` at `~/.claude/legion/portfolio.md`

**Skills invoked:** `workflow-common` → `questioning-flow` → `agent-registry` → `portfolio-manager` | `codebase-mapper` (optional brownfield)
**Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, AskUserQuestion
**Produces:** `.planning/PROJECT.md`, `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, `.planning/STATE.md` | `.planning/CODEBASE.md` (brownfield)
**User interaction:** Guided Q&A throughout; confirms generated documents before finalizing

#### `/legion:plan <N>` — Phase Planning

Decomposes a roadmap phase into wave-structured plans with a default max of 3 tasks each (configurable via settings). Recommends agents from the 51-agent registry for each plan and gets your confirmation.

**Key steps:**
1. Parse or auto-detect the next unplanned phase from STATE.md
2. Load phase context — reads ROADMAP.md requirements, prior phase summaries, and `CODEBASE.md` if brownfield (injects risk areas and conventions into plan tasks)
3. Detect domain-specific workflows — `marketing-workflows` activates for MKT-* requirements (campaign briefs, content calendars), `design-workflows` activates for DSN-* requirements (design systems, three-lens review)
4. *(Optional)* Architecture proposals — spawns 2-3 read-only Explore agents with competing philosophies (Minimal, Clean, Pragmatic) for complex phases; user selects an approach
5. *(Optional)* Spec pipeline — 5-stage specification process (gather → research → write → critique → assess) producing a structured spec at `.planning/specs/`
6. Decompose into plans via `phase-decomposer` — default max 3 tasks per plan (configurable), grouped into dependency waves (parallel within, sequential between)
7. Recommend agents per plan using `agent-registry` scoring (keyword match 3pts, division affinity 2pts, partial match 1pt, memory boost from past outcomes)
8. *(Optional)* Plan critique — spawns 2 read-only Explore agents (`testing-reality-checker` for pre-mortem, `product-sprint-prioritizer` for assumption hunting) with PASS/CAUTION/REWORK verdicts
9. Generate plan files with full task instructions, verification commands, and YAML frontmatter
10. *(Optional)* GitHub issue creation via `github-sync` — creates a labeled issue with plan checklist

**Skills invoked:** `workflow-common` → `phase-decomposer` → `agent-registry` → `memory-manager` | `codebase-mapper` (brownfield) | `marketing-workflows` | `design-workflows` | `spec-pipeline` | `plan-critique` | `github-sync` (all optional)
**Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, AskUserQuestion
**Produces:** `.planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/CONTEXT.md` and `{NN}-{PP}-PLAN.md` files | `.planning/specs/` (optional) | `.planning/campaigns/` (marketing) | `.planning/designs/` (design)
**User interaction:** Confirms agent recommendations; opts into architecture proposals, spec pipeline, and plan critique; reviews critique findings

#### `/legion:build` — Phase Execution

Spawns agents with full personality injection to execute all plans for the current phase. Runs waves in parallel, tracks progress, and commits completed work.

**Key steps:**
1. Determine target phase from STATE.md or `--phase N` flag; validate plan files exist
2. Discover plans via `wave-executor` — parse YAML frontmatter, build wave map, validate no circular dependencies or file conflicts
3. Create a Claude Code Team via TeamCreate (`phase-{NN}-execution`) with TaskCreate for each plan and cross-wave dependencies via TaskUpdate
4. Execute plans wave by wave via `wave-executor` — all agents within a wave spawn in parallel via Agent tool with `model: "sonnet"`
5. Each agent receives its complete personality .md (80-350 lines) concatenated with the plan file as its prompt; autonomous plans skip personality injection
6. Agents auto-remediate environment issues (missing deps, wrong versions) — classify errors as BLOCKER vs ENVIRONMENT, retry once after remediation
7. Collect results via SendMessage — parse structured summaries, write `{NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md` files
8. Track progress via `execution-tracker` — update STATE.md, ROADMAP.md progress table, create atomic git commits per successful plan
9. Record outcomes via `memory-manager` (optional) — agent, task type, success/failure, importance score with time-decay
10. Detect manual edits — intersect agent-modified files with `git diff` to capture corrective preference signals
11. Shutdown team via SendMessage shutdown_request + TeamDelete

**Skills invoked:** `workflow-common` → `wave-executor` → `execution-tracker` → `memory-manager` | `codebase-mapper` (brownfield context injection) | `github-sync` (issue checklist + PR creation)
**Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Agent, TeamCreate, TeamDelete, TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskList, SendMessage, AskUserQuestion
**Produces:** Implementation artifacts plus `{NN}-{PP}-SUMMARY.md` files, atomic git commits, optional GitHub PR
**User interaction:** Confirms pre-execution plan; monitors progress; resolves blockers if agents get stuck

#### `/legion:review` — Quality Review

Selects appropriate review agents for the phase, runs a structured dev-QA loop (default max 3 cycles, configurable), and marks the phase complete only after review passes.

**Key steps:**
1. Determine target phase and load build summaries — reads CONTEXT.md, all PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md files, builds deduplicated file list for review
2. Detect manual edits — intersects `git diff` with agent-modified files before review begins, stores corrective preferences via `memory-manager`
3. Choose review mode: **classic** (`review-loop` — static phase-type-to-agent mapping) or **panel** (`review-panel` — dynamic 2-4 reviewer composition with domain-weighted rubrics)
   - Classic mapping: code → `testing-reality-checker` + `testing-evidence-collector`; API → `testing-api-tester`; design → three-lens review (`brand-guardian` + `ux-architect` + `ux-researcher`); marketing → `testing-workflow-optimizer`
   - Panel mode: scores all review-capable agents via `agent-registry`, caps panel size (2 single-domain, 3 standard, 4 cross-domain), enforces max 2 per division + at least 1 Testing agent, assigns non-overlapping rubrics
4. Create a Claude Code Team via TeamCreate (`phase-{NN}-review`)
5. Spawn review agents in parallel — each receives full personality .md + phase context + rubric (panel mode); all agents spawn in a single response via Agent tool with `model: "sonnet"`
6. Collect findings via SendMessage — parse severity (BLOCKER/WARNING/SUGGESTION), deduplicate across reviewers, triage into must-fix and nice-to-have
7. Panel synthesis (panel mode only) — cross-cutting themes, hot spots (files flagged by 2+ reviewers), aggregate verdict
8. Route fixes — group findings by file type, spawn appropriate fix agents (frontend → `engineering-frontend-developer`, backend → `engineering-backend-architect`, etc.), create fix commits
9. Re-review — scoped to modified files, bounded by configured max cycles (default 3); escalate to user if blockers persist
10. On PASS: write `{NN}-REVIEW.md`, mark phase complete in STATE.md + ROADMAP.md, close GitHub issue (optional)
11. On ESCALATE: present remaining blockers with fix attempt history, offer manual fix / accept-as-is / investigate options
12. Shutdown team via SendMessage + TeamDelete

**Skills invoked:** `workflow-common` → `review-loop` | `review-panel` → `execution-tracker` → `memory-manager` | `design-workflows` (three-lens) | `github-sync`
**Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Agent, TeamCreate, TeamDelete, TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskList, SendMessage, AskUserQuestion
**Produces:** `{NN}-REVIEW.md`, fix commits, updated STATE.md and ROADMAP.md
**User interaction:** Chooses review mode; confirms reviewer selection; reviews findings; approves fixes; decides escalation path

### Navigation

#### `/legion:status` — Progress Dashboard

Single command to understand where the project is and what to do next. Reads all project state and displays a clear dashboard with session resume context.

**Key steps:**
1. Load project state — reads PROJECT.md, STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, REQUIREMENTS.md (if exists)
2. Calculate progress via `execution-tracker` — 20-char progress bar from ROADMAP.md plan counts
3. Display milestone progress via `milestone-tracker` (if milestones defined)
4. Load memory briefing via `memory-manager` (if OUTCOMES.md exists) — last 5 outcomes, top 3 agents by success rate
5. Check codebase map staleness (if CODEBASE.md exists and >30 days old, suggest refresh)
6. Fetch GitHub status via `github-sync` (if STATE.md has GitHub section) — live issue/PR/milestone state via `gh` CLI
7. Route to next action — decision tree: no project → start; pending → plan; planned → build; executed → review; complete → next phase or finish

**Skills invoked:** `workflow-common` → `execution-tracker` → `milestone-tracker` | `memory-manager` | `github-sync` | `codebase-mapper` (staleness check)
**Tools:** Read, Grep, Glob (read-only — no file modifications)
**Produces:** Dashboard display (no file changes)
**User interaction:** Follow the suggested next action, or run any command

---

### Ad-hoc

#### `/legion:quick <task>` — One-off Task Execution

Run any task outside the normal phase workflow with automatic agent selection. No phase planning required.

**Key steps:**
1. Parse the task description from arguments — works with or without an initialized project
2. Load project context (optional) — reads PROJECT.md for tech stack awareness if available
3. Score agents via `agent-registry` (keyword match 3pts, division affinity 2pts, partial match 1pt) and recommend top 2 candidates
4. Spawn the selected agent via Agent tool with `model: "sonnet"` and full personality injection — or run autonomously if user prefers
5. Return results with an optional conventional commit (auto-detects type: feat/fix/test/docs/refactor from task description)

**Skills invoked:** `workflow-common` → `agent-registry`
**Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Agent, AskUserQuestion
**Produces:** Task output plus optional git commit (does NOT update STATE.md or ROADMAP.md)
**User interaction:** Confirms agent selection; approves commit

#### `/legion:advise <topic>` — Expert Consultation

Get read-only strategic advice from any of the 51 agent personalities. The advisor can explore your codebase and ask clarifying questions but cannot modify any files.

**Key steps:**
1. Parse the topic (architecture, UX, marketing strategy, etc.) — provides a topic reference table spanning Engineering, Design, Business, Marketing, Testing, Product, and Spatial Computing
2. Load project context from PROJECT.md if available (works without it for pure domain expertise)
3. Score and recommend the best advisor via `agent-registry` — top 2 candidates presented with match rationale
4. Spawn the advisor as a read-only **Explore** subagent (tool-level enforcement: no Write, no Edit, no Bash) with full personality injection and `model: "sonnet"`
5. Display structured advice: Assessment → Recommendations → Trade-offs → Next Steps
6. Interactive follow-up loop — ask another question (same advisor, carries prior context), switch topics (new advisor), or end session

**Skills invoked:** `workflow-common` → `agent-registry`
**Tools:** Read, Grep, Glob, Agent, AskUserQuestion (advisor spawned as Explore — cannot modify files)
**Produces:** Advisory output (no file changes, no state updates)
**User interaction:** Selects advisor agent; asks follow-up questions; ends session when satisfied

---

### Management

#### `/legion:portfolio` — Multi-Project Dashboard

Cross-project visibility when managing multiple Legion projects. Shows dependency tracking, agent allocation, and offers strategic coordination from the Studio Producer agent.

**Key steps:**
1. Load the global portfolio registry (`~/.claude/legion/portfolio.md`) — validates each project path exists, reads each project's STATE.md and ROADMAP.md
2. Display all projects with progress bars, health indicators (`[OK]` green / `[!!]` yellow / `[XX]` red), sorted by health then recency
3. Display cross-project dependencies — checks live phase completion status, flags blocking vs resolved
4. Display agent allocation — shared agents across projects, division coverage table (requires 2+ projects)
5. Interactive operations: view project details, add cross-project dependencies, invoke Studio Producer analysis
6. Studio Producer consultation (optional) — spawns `project-management-studio-producer` via Agent tool with `model: "opus"` for strategic portfolio coordination

**Skills invoked:** `workflow-common` → `portfolio-manager` → `agent-registry`
**Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Agent, AskUserQuestion
**Produces:** Dashboard display; optional portfolio registry updates and Studio Producer analysis
**User interaction:** Reviews dashboard; adds dependencies; requests strategic coordination; exits when done

#### `/legion:milestone` — Milestone Lifecycle

Handles the full milestone lifecycle: define milestone groupings, track status, mark milestones complete with summaries, and archive completed artifacts.

**Key steps:**
1. Load project state — checks for existing `## Milestones` section in ROADMAP.md; offers to define milestones if none exist
2. Display milestone dashboard via `milestone-tracker` — phase-level progress with 10-char progress bars per milestone
3. Define milestones — analyzes phases for logical groupings (theme clusters, dependency chains), proposes 2-4 milestones with 3-7 phases each
4. Complete milestone — validates all phases are Complete, generates summary at `.planning/milestones/MILESTONE-{N}.md` with metrics (plans, requirements, files, agents), closes GitHub milestone via `github-sync` (optional)
5. Archive milestone — moves phase directories from `.planning/phases/` to `.planning/archive/milestone-{N}/`, condenses STATE.md, updates ROADMAP.md

**Skills invoked:** `workflow-common` → `milestone-tracker` → `execution-tracker` | `github-sync`
**Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, AskUserQuestion
**Produces:** Updated ROADMAP.md, milestone summaries at `.planning/milestones/`, archived phase directories at `.planning/archive/`
**User interaction:** Selects milestone operation; confirms completion and archiving

#### `/legion:agent` — Agent Creator

Create a new specialist agent when the 51 existing personalities don't cover your needs. Guided conversation produces a validated agent .md file and registers it in the catalog.

**Key steps:**
1. Stage 1: Agent Identity — adaptive conversation via `agent-creator` to define role, specialty, and division (infers kebab-case name like `{division}-{specialty}`)
2. Stage 2: Capabilities & Personality — captures top 3-5 unique capabilities, communication style, and hard rules; shows example agents (engineering, testing, design) for reference
3. Stage 3: Registry Tags — generates 3-5 task type tags aligned with existing `agent-registry` taxonomy; presents for confirmation
4. Schema validation — runs 8 checks (name uniqueness, format regex, description, color, division, 50+ line body, heading check, name in body); blocks until all pass
5. Generate files — writes agent .md file to `agents/` with YAML frontmatter + substantive personality (80-120 lines), inserts catalog row into `agent-registry`
6. Git commit — stages agent file + registry update

**Skills invoked:** `workflow-common` → `agent-creator` → `agent-registry`
**Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, AskUserQuestion
**Produces:** New agent personality file in `agents/`, updated `agent-registry` SKILL.md
**User interaction:** Guided 3-stage Q&A; reviews and confirms the generated personality and registry tags

## v2.0 Advisory Features

Three capabilities shipped in v2.0 that extend the core workflow with read-only analysis and multi-perspective review.

### Strategic Advisors (`/legion:advise`)

Lightweight expert consultation without the overhead of phase workflows or the risk of code changes.

- **Read-only by design** — advisors are spawned as Explore agents (tool-level enforcement: no Write, no Edit, no Bash)
- **Topic-based agent selection** — the registry algorithm scores all 51 agents against the topic and recommends the best match
- **Full personality injection** — the advisor operates in complete character with its specialist expertise, communication style, and hard rules
- **Project-aware** — loads PROJECT.md context when available, but works without it for pure domain expertise
- **Interactive follow-up** — after initial advice, continue with follow-up questions, switch topics, or end the session
- **No state changes** — advisory sessions never update STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, or any project files

### Dynamic Review Panels

Context-aware multi-perspective review teams that replace static reviewer mapping with dynamic composition.

- **2-4 reviewers** — panel size scales with domain complexity: 2 for single-domain, 3 for standard, 4 for cross-domain phases
- **Domain-weighted rubrics** — each reviewer evaluates against 3-5 non-overlapping criteria specific to their specialty (Production Readiness, Verification Completeness, Brand Consistency, etc.)
- **No criterion overlap** — rubric design ensures reviewers check different aspects of the work, not the same things from different angles
- **Diversity enforcement** — max 2 reviewers from the same division; at least one Testing agent on every panel
- **Cross-cutting synthesis** — findings are deduplicated across reviewers, hot spots identified (files flagged by 2+ reviewers), and an aggregate verdict computed
- **Panel vs. classic mode** — users choose during `/legion:review`; classic mode uses the original static phase-type-to-agent mapping

### Plan Critique

Pre-execution stress testing that catches plan weaknesses before agents start building.

- **Pre-mortem analysis** — assumes the phase has already failed and works backward to identify 3-5 specific failure scenarios with root causes, likelihood, and impact scores
- **Assumption hunting** — extracts 5-10 implicit assumptions from the plan, rates each by impact and evidence strength, and flags critical ones (high impact + weak evidence)
- **Three verdicts** — PASS (proceed), CAUTION (addressable risks, review mitigations), REWORK (plan needs revision)
- **Maps to plan sections** — every finding traces to a specific task in a specific plan file with an actionable mitigation or challenge action
- **Optional step** — activates when the user selects it during `/legion:plan`; does not run automatically
- **Read-only agents** — critique agents are spawned as Explore subagents to prevent plan modification

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

Legion didn't invent its patterns from scratch. It cherry-picked the best ideas from twelve proven Claude Code projects, combined them into something greater than the sum of its parts, and left behind the complexity that made each hard to adopt.

### What We Took (and What We Left Behind)

#### The 51 Agent Personalities — [msitarzewski/agency-agents](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents)

The 51 specialist personalities that power Legion originated in the agency-agents repository by msitarzewski. These are not generic role labels — they are 37-434 line character sheets (target band: 80-350 lines) with deep expertise, communication styles, hard rules, and personality quirks across 9 divisions. Legion builds orchestration, planning, and review workflows on top of these personalities, but the personalities themselves are the foundation everything else stands on.

#### From [GSD (Get Shit Done)](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done)

**Took: The conversation engine and state management philosophy.**

GSD's adaptive questioning flow is the gold standard for understanding what a user actually wants before jumping to implementation. We adopted its 3-stage pattern (vision → requirements → constraints) where the conversation explores the *why* before the *what*, targeting 5-8 natural exchanges rather than rigid checklists. GSD's `.planning/` directory with human-readable markdown state files (PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md) became our foundation — no databases, no JSON blobs, just files you can read with `cat`.

We also adopted GSD's orchestrator/subagent split: a coordinator manages the workflow while specialized agents do the actual work, each in a fresh context window so they don't get confused by accumulated state.

**Left behind:** GSD's 33+ workflow files, custom CLI tooling (`gsd-tools.cjs`), complex configuration system, and heavyweight milestone management. GSD is powerful but requires significant setup. We wanted the patterns without the infrastructure.

#### From [Conductor](https://github.com/Ibrahim-3d/conductor-orchestrator-superpowers)

**Took: The evaluate-loop and quality gate architecture.**

Conductor's build → review → fix cycle is the right way to ensure quality. Our `review-loop.md` skill implements this as a structured dev-QA loop: review agents provide specific, actionable feedback (not vague "looks good"), fixes are applied, and re-review confirms the fix — with a hard cap of 3 cycles before escalating to the user. No infinite retry loops.

Conductor's parallel dispatch pattern — spawning multiple specialized evaluators simultaneously — became our wave execution model. And its concept of typed evaluators (different reviewers for different work) became our phase-type mapping: code gets Reality Checker + Evidence Collector, design gets the three-lens review (brand + accessibility + usability), marketing gets Workflow Optimizer, and so on.

**Left behind:** Conductor's board-of-directors governance model (5 directors debating is overkill for most projects), file-based message bus IPC, 50+ iteration limits, and `metadata.json` state tracking. Conductor optimizes for correctness through redundancy; we optimize for shipping through focused review.

#### From [Shipyard](https://github.com/lgbarn/shipyard)

**Took: Wave-based execution, plan constraints, and atomic commits.**

Shipyard's wave model is elegant: organize plans into dependency waves, execute everything within a wave in parallel, then advance to the next wave. This gives you maximum parallelism without dependency conflicts. We adopted it directly in `wave-executor.md`.

Shipyard's max-3-tasks-per-plan constraint keeps work focused and reviewable. More than 3 tasks and plans become unwieldy — agents lose context, reviews get superficial, and failures are hard to diagnose. We enforce this in `phase-decomposer.md`.

Atomic commits per completed plan (from Shipyard's `execution-tracker`) means every unit of work is independently revertable. If Plan 2 breaks something, you can roll back without losing Plan 1's progress.

**Left behind:** Shipyard's 29 commands, checkpoint/rollback system, and complex hook infrastructure. Shipyard is a full project management platform; we just wanted its execution discipline.

#### From [Best Practice Config](https://github.com/shanraisshan/claude-code-best-practice)

**Took: The plugin architecture and agent contract.**

Best Practice's `.claude/` directory structure (commands → skills → agents) is the canonical way to build Claude Code plugins. We adopted it wholesale: commands are entry points, skills are reusable logic, agents are personalities. Clean separation of concerns.

Best Practice's agent frontmatter schema (YAML with name, description, color, division) became our agent contract. Every one of our 51 agents follows this structure, which means the `agent-registry.md` can programmatically catalog and recommend agents based on structured metadata rather than parsing free-form text.

**Left behind:** Best Practice's RPI workflow (too domain-specific) and custom hooks infrastructure. We kept the architecture patterns and dropped the opinionated workflows.

#### From [Daem0n-MCP](https://github.com/9thLevelSoftware/Daem0n-MCP)

**Took: The semantic memory architecture.**

Daem0n-MCP proved that AI agents can learn across sessions through structured outcome tracking with importance scoring and time-based decay. We adopted its core memory primitives — store, recall, and decay — as our `memory-manager.md` skill. After each build/review cycle, outcomes are recorded with agent ID, task type, success/failure, and importance score. During future planning, past outcomes are queried to boost agent recommendations, weighted by a 4-bracket decay curve (1.0 for recent, down to 0.1 for old) so the system improves over time without getting stuck in historical patterns.

The key insight from Daem0n was computing decay at recall time rather than destructively aging stored data. This means the full outcome history is always preserved — you can audit every decision — while relevance scoring adapts naturally as time passes.

**Left behind:** Daem0n's hook-driven architecture (memory operations triggered automatically on every tool call) and MCP server dependency. Our memory layer is called explicitly by Legion workflows and stored as a single markdown table at `.planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md` — no server process, no hooks, no background sync. Everything degrades gracefully if the memory file doesn't exist.

#### From [Feature-dev](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/feature-dev)

**Took: Confidence-based review filtering and competing architecture proposals.**

Feature-dev's review system uses 80%+ confidence thresholds — reviewers only report findings they're genuinely confident about, avoiding the noise of speculative warnings. We adopted this principle in our review agents' instructions: report specific, actionable findings, not vague "looks good" or hedged suggestions. Feature-dev's competing architecture designs (2-3 approaches evaluated before implementation) became our architecture proposals in `/legion:plan` step 3.5, where read-only Explore agents with Minimal, Clean, and Pragmatic philosophies present trade-offs for the user to evaluate.

**Left behind:** Feature-dev's 3-agent-only model (explorer, architect, reviewer), lack of state persistence between sessions, and no quick/ad-hoc task mode.

#### From [code-foundations](https://github.com/ryanthedev/code-foundations)

**Took: Anti-rationalization discipline and evidence-backed verification.**

Code-foundations' anti-rationalization tables — explicit boundaries for what agents decide autonomously vs. what requires human approval — became our Authority Matrix. The principle that agents should never rationalize "it's a small change" to bypass approval is baked into our escalation protocol. Evidence-backed checklists (every claim must be verifiable) became our plan verification commands: each task in a plan file has a `<verify>` block with specific commands to run, so completion is provable, not asserted.

**Left behind:** The 614-check pipeline (our agents run focused verification per task, not exhaustive checklists), the heavy token consumption from running every check on every file, and the rigid pipeline structure that doesn't adapt to project type.

#### From [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)

**Took: Git-native state and actor-based audit trails.**

Beads proved that git is the right state management layer for AI agent systems — not SQLite, not JSON, not custom databases. All Legion state lives in `.planning/` as markdown files tracked by git: every state change is a commit, every decision is auditable via `git log`, and rollback is just `git revert`. Beads' actor-based audit trails — tracking which agent did what and why — became our SUMMARY.md files (per-plan execution reports) and OUTCOMES.md (cross-session agent performance tracking).

**Left behind:** Beads' scope creep (it tries to be a full development framework), the MEOW naming convention, and the $100+/hour cost profile that makes it impractical for most projects.

#### From [Auto-Claude](https://github.com/AndyMik90/Auto-Claude)

**Took: Multi-stage spec pipeline and environment auto-remediation.**

Auto-Claude's spec pipeline — a structured multi-stage process that produces detailed specifications before code generation — became our `spec-pipeline` skill available as an optional step in `/legion:plan`. The 5-stage process (gather → research → write → critique → assess) ensures agents build against a validated spec rather than vague requirements. Auto-Claude's environment auto-remediation patterns — detecting and fixing missing dependencies, wrong versions, and missing directories during execution — were adopted directly in our `wave-executor` agent prompts as the BLOCKER/ENVIRONMENT error classification system.

**Left behind:** The 1,751-file codebase, the Python-Electron architecture split, the 50-iteration QA cycles, and the complex worktree isolation system. We kept the spec discipline and resilience patterns without the infrastructure weight.

#### From [bjarne](https://github.com/Dekadinious/bjarne)

**Took: Verification points and stale loop detection.**

Bjarne's verification points — mandatory checks after each step that prevent agents from proceeding on broken state — became our `<verify>` blocks in plan task definitions. Every task has a verify command that must pass before the agent moves to the next task. Bjarne's stale loop detection — recognizing when an agent is retrying the same failing action — informed our hard cap of 3 review cycles: if the dev-QA loop hasn't resolved blockers after 3 rounds, the problem is systemic and gets escalated to the user rather than spinning indefinitely. Bjarne's verbose output redirection (redirect noisy build output to temp files, show only on failure) is adopted in our agent execution resilience instructions.

**Left behind:** The 2,500 lines of Bash (we use zero shell scripts), the absence of any test suite, and the single-file architecture that made it hard to extend.

#### From [Puzld.ai](https://github.com/MedChaouch/Puzld.ai)

**Took: Preference extraction and debate-with-winner-tracking.**

Puzld.ai's DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) extraction pattern — capturing which of several competing options the user prefers — became our preference capture system in `memory-manager` Section 13. When the user selects an architecture proposal, overrides a review finding, or manually edits agent output, Legion records the decision as a preference signal (positive, corrective, or negative) that informs future recommendations. Puzld.ai's debate-with-winner-tracking — presenting multiple approaches and recording which one wins — maps directly to our competing architecture proposals and agent selection confirmation, where the user's choice is stored as a signal.

**Left behind:** The near-zero test coverage, the 95 releases in 3 months (velocity without stability), and the DPO-specific terminology that made the system harder to understand.

### What Legion Added

Beyond combining these twelve projects, Legion introduced several original patterns:

- **Personality-first agents**: The 51 agent personalities aren't just role labels — they're 37-434 line character sheets (target band: 80-350 lines) with expertise, communication style, hard rules, and personality quirks, all in a standardized emoji-headed format. When an agent is spawned, it receives its *complete personality* as system instructions, not a generic "you are a backend developer" prompt.

- **Hybrid agent selection**: The workflow recommends agents based on task analysis (keyword matching, division affinity, past performance), but the user always confirms or overrides. No black-box assignment.

- **Domain-specific workflow detection**: When `/legion:plan` encounters marketing requirements (MKT-*) or design requirements (DSN-*), it automatically switches to domain-specific wave patterns and team assembly — campaign planning with content calendars for marketing, design systems with three-lens review for design — instead of forcing engineering patterns onto non-engineering work.

- **Graceful degradation everywhere**: GitHub integration, cross-session memory, brownfield analysis, marketing workflows, and design workflows are all opt-in features that activate when their prerequisites exist and skip silently when they don't. The core workflow (start → plan → build → review) works identically with or without any optional feature.

- **Cross-session memory with decay**: After each build/review cycle, outcomes are recorded with importance scores. During future planning, past outcomes boost agent recommendations — but with time-based decay (recent outcomes matter more), so the system doesn't get stuck in historical patterns.

### Design Choices and Tradeoffs

Legion intentionally optimizes for orchestration ergonomics (few commands, markdown-first state, personality injection) over strict uniformity across all runtimes. The table below summarizes the tradeoffs against other orchestration systems:

| Design Axis | Typical Alternative | Legion Choice | Tradeoff |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------|----------|
| Command surface | 15-33+ command sets | 11 commands | Faster onboarding, but less granular command specialization |
| State storage | JSON/DB/hybrid state | Markdown-only `.planning/` | Human-readable and git-native, but less strict schema enforcement |
| Setup model | CLI bootstrap + config | `npx` installer | Simpler install path, but runtime capabilities can vary more |
| Agent model | Generic role prompts | 51 full personalities | Higher domain specificity, but larger context footprint |
| Runtime coverage | Single-runtime focus | 9 runtime adapters | Broader portability, but feature parity differs by runtime tier |
| Memory strategy | Hook-based/global memory | Project-local explicit memory | Better project isolation, but requires explicit integration points |

Current repository metrics: 11 commands, 18 skills, 51 agent personalities, and 9 runtime adapters.

## The 51 Agents

Agents are organized across 9 divisions, each with deep specialist personalities:

| Division | Agents | Focus |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Engineering | 7 | Full-stack, backend, frontend, AI, DevOps, mobile, prototyping |
| Design | 6 | UI/UX, branding, visual storytelling, research |
| Marketing | 8 | Content, social media, growth, platform strategies |
| Testing | 7 | QA, evidence collection, performance, API testing |
| Product | 3 | Sprint planning, feedback synthesis, trends |
| Project Management | 5 | Coordination, portfolio, operations, experiments |
| Support | 6 | Analytics, finance, legal, infrastructure |
| Spatial Computing | 6 | VisionOS, XR, Metal, terminal integration |
| Specialized | 3 | Orchestration, data analytics, LSP indexing |

## Design Principles

- **Personality-first**: Agent .md files are the source of truth for behavior
- **CLI-agnostic**: Works with 9 AI CLI runtimes — skills, commands, and agents adapt via per-runtime adapters (support tiers listed below)
- **Human-readable state**: All planning files are markdown, readable without tools
- **Full personality injection**: Agents are spawned with their complete .md as instructions
- **Standardized format**: All 51 agents use Format A — emoji section headings, "Your" pronouns, current range 37-434 lines (target 80-350)
- **Balanced cost**: Opus for planning, Sonnet for execution, Haiku for checks
- **Default max 3 tasks per plan (configurable)**: Keeps work focused and reviewable
- **Hybrid selection**: Workflow recommends agents, user confirms or overrides
- **Wave execution**: Plans grouped by dependency; parallel within waves, sequential between
- **Graceful degradation**: Optional features (GitHub, memory, marketing, design, panels, critique) activate when available, skip silently when not
- **Read-only advisory**: Consultation agents explore but never modify — tool-level enforcement via Explore subagent type
- **Domain-weighted review**: Each reviewer evaluates against non-overlapping criteria scoped to their expertise, not generic checklists

## Optional Features

These activate automatically when their prerequisites are met:

| Feature | Activates When | What It Does |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **GitHub Integration** | `gh` CLI authenticated + git remote exists | Links phases to issues, creates PRs, syncs milestones |
| **Cross-Session Memory** | `.planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md` exists | Boosts agent recommendations based on past performance |
| **Brownfield Analysis** | Existing codebase detected during `/legion:start` | Maps architecture, frameworks, risks before planning |
| **Marketing Workflows** | MKT-* requirements or marketing keywords in phase | Campaign planning, content calendars, channel coordination |
| **Design Workflows** | DSN-* requirements or design keywords in phase | Design systems, UX research, three-lens review (brand + accessibility + usability) |
| **Plan Critique** | User selects critique during `/legion:plan` | Pre-mortem analysis, assumption hunting, PASS/CAUTION/REWORK verdicts |
| **Review Panels** | User selects panel mode in `/legion:review` | 2-4 domain-weighted reviewers with non-overlapping rubrics |
