## Workflow

```
/legion:start → /legion:plan 1 → /legion:build → /legion:review → /legion:plan 2 → ...
```

Each phase: plan (decompose + assign agents) → build (execution — parallel or sequential per CLI) → review (QA loop)

Advisory: `/legion:advise <topic>` — standalone consultation, no phase context needed

GitHub integration is opt-in — when a GitHub remote exists, `/legion:plan` creates issues, `/legion:build` creates PRs, and `/legion:status` shows GitHub status.

Brownfield support is automatic — when `/legion:start` detects an existing codebase, it offers to analyze architecture, frameworks, risks, dependency graphs, test coverage, API surface, config/environment, and code patterns. The analysis produces `.planning/CODEBASE.md`, consumed by 5 commands: `/legion:plan` injects context into phase decomposition, `/legion:build` injects conventions and guidance into agent execution prompts, `/legion:review` injects conventions for conformance checking, `/legion:plan` (critique) cross-references risks during pre-mortem analysis, and `/legion:status` detects staleness. Standalone re-analysis is available via `/legion:quick analyze codebase`.

Marketing workflows activate when `/legion:plan` detects a marketing-focused phase (MKT-* requirements or marketing keywords). Campaign planning produces structured documents at `.planning/campaigns/`, with content calendars and cross-channel coordination across the 8 marketing agents.

Design workflows activate when `/legion:plan` detects a design-focused phase (DSN-* requirements or design keywords). Design system creation produces structured documents at `.planning/designs/`, with component specifications and three-lens review (brand, accessibility, usability) across the 6 design agents.

## Authority Matrix

Explicit boundaries for what agents decide autonomously vs. what requires human approval.

### Autonomous (agents proceed without asking)

| Decision | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| File edits within assigned task scope | Only files listed in the plan's `files_modified` |
| Writing and running tests | Test files for code the agent is implementing |
| Installing declared dependencies | Dependencies explicitly listed in task instructions |
| Code formatting and linting fixes | Auto-fixable issues within modified files |
| Creating files specified in the plan | Only paths listed in plan artifacts |
| Committing completed work | Atomic commits per completed plan task |

### Human Approval Required

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Architecture changes (new patterns, new abstractions) | Architectural choices compound — wrong abstractions are expensive to undo |
| Adding unplanned dependencies | Dependencies are permanent weight; every `npm install` is a maintenance commitment |
| Modifying files outside task scope | Scope creep is the #1 agent failure mode; stay in your lane |
| Database schema changes | Schema migrations are irreversible in production |
| API contract changes (endpoints, request/response shapes) | Consumers depend on stability; breaking changes cascade |
| Deleting existing functionality | Deletion is irreversible; what looks unused might be depended on elsewhere |
| Changing CI/CD or deployment configuration | Infrastructure changes affect the entire team |
| Overriding review findings or skipping quality gates | Quality gates exist for a reason; agents don't get to decide they're optional |

### Escalation Protocol

When an agent encounters a decision that falls outside its autonomous scope:
1. **Stop** — do not proceed with the out-of-scope action
2. **Document** — note what decision is needed and why in the task output
3. **Continue** — work on other in-scope items while waiting for human input
4. **Never rationalize** — "it's a small change" or "it's obviously fine" are not valid reasons to skip approval

## Memory Layer (Optional)

After build/review cycles, outcomes are recorded to `.planning/memory/OUTCOMES.md`. During planning, past outcomes boost agent recommendations. During status, recent outcomes enrich the session briefing. All memory features degrade gracefully — the system works identically without them.

## Conventions

- **Personality-first**: Agent .md files are the source of truth for agent behavior
- **Full injection**: Agents are spawned with their complete personality as instructions
- **Max 3 tasks per plan**: Keeps work focused and reviewable
- **Wave execution**: Plans grouped into dependency waves; parallel within (if CLI supports it), sequential between
- **Cost profile**: Planning/execution/check tiers mapped to CLI-specific model names via adapter
- **CLI-agnostic core**: All skills and commands reference generic adapter concepts; per-CLI adapters define the implementation
- **Human-readable state**: All planning files are markdown — no binary state
- **Hybrid selection**: Workflow recommends agents, user confirms or overrides
